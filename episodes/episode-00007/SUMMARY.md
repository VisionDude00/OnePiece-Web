## Highlights & Significance

### Episode Importance
Episode 7 is significant for several reasons:

1. **First Major Technique Debut** - Oni Giri becomes one of the most iconic moves in One Piece
2. **Character Development** - Zoro's honor vs. Cabaji's dirty tactics
3. **Emotional Depth** - Luffy's genuine rage when his treasure (the hat) is damaged
4. **Long-term Foreshadowing** - Buggy-Shanks connection pays off hundreds of episodes later
5. **Fighting Dynamics** - Establishes pattern of Zoro fighting second-in-command

### Key Themes
- **Honor and Determination** - Zoro's honorable fighting despite injury
- **Precious Treasures** - Different values: hat (emotional) vs. gold vs. maps
- **Interconnected World** - Hints at larger pirate world connections

### Foreshadowing Elements
- Oni Giri's demon theme → Asura manifestation later
- Buggy-Shanks grudge → Roger Pirates backstory reveal
- Straw hat importance → Endgame significance with Joy Boy
- Nami's map interest → Navigator role and world-mapping dream
