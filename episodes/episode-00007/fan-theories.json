    "fullText": "When Buggy reacts so strongly to Shanks' name in Episode 7, cursing him and showing deep anger, it hints at a complex shared history. Early fans theorized that Buggy and Shanks must have been close at some point, possibly serving on the same crew, which would explain the intensity of Buggy's grudge. This theory was later confirmed when it was revealed they both served on Gol D. Roger's crew as apprentices.",
