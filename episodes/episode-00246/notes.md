# Episode 246 Research Notes

## Overview
Episode 246 "Destruction of the Straw Hat Pirates? The Terror of the Model Leopard!" is a pivotal episode in the Water 7 Arc that showcases CP9's overwhelming power and sets up the emotional storyline between Franky and Usopp.

## Key Research Findings

### Devil Fruit Debut
- This episode marks the anime debut of the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard (though it was shown in silhouette in Episode 245)
- The transformation scene is dramatic and establishes Lucci as a major threat
- First clear demonstration that CP9 members have Devil Fruit abilities in addition to Rokushiki

### Power Scaling
- The ease with which Lucci defeats both Luffy and Zoro simultaneously is shocking
- This represents one of the Straw Hats' most complete defeats in the series
- Sets up the need for Luffy to develop Gear Second and Third
- Demonstrates the power gap between the crew and World Government elite forces

### Emotional Storyline
- The parallel storyline of Franky and Usopp bonding over ships is beautifully done
- Franky's tears show unexpected emotional depth for what initially seemed like an antagonistic character
- The introduction of the Klabautermann concept validates Usopp's Skypiea experience
- Sets up Franky's eventual joining of the crew and his relationship with Usopp

### Music Significance
- First episode to use "Dear Friends" by TRIPLANE as ending theme
- The song is dedicated to Going Merry and later plays during the ship's funeral in Episode 312
- This choice of ending theme is thematically perfect given the episode's focus on Usopp's love for the Merry

### Production Notes
- TV rating of 16.7% (#1 in timeslot) shows high viewer interest
- Second eyecatchers for Sanji and Usopp debut in this episode
- Adapted from manga Chapters 349-350
