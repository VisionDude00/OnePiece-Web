## Challenges and Questions

### Challenges During Research
1. **Limited Script Access** - Could not find complete episode scripts for detailed dialogue extraction
2. **Timestamp Approximation** - Timestamps are approximate based on typical episode pacing, not from actual viewing
3. **YouTube Content** - Specific reaction videos for episode 561 were limited; found mostly arc-wide coverage
4. **Voice Actor Information** - Some supporting characters (Neptune princes, New Fish-Man Pirates officers) have incomplete voice actor data

### Questions for Review
1. Should we include more minor character moments from background Straw Hats (Zoro, Sanji, Robin, Franky)?
2. Are the timestamp approximations acceptable, or should actual episode viewing be required?
3. Should anime-original scenes be marked with higher or lower severity than manga-canon events?

### Notable Gaps
1. **Missing Voice Actors**: Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi, Manboshi voice actors not confirmed in sources
2. **Exact Dialogue**: Many quotes are paraphrased or summarized rather than exact transcriptions
3. **Specific Techniques**: Some combat techniques used may not have official names documented
4. **Episode Script**: No complete script found for line-by-line annotation

## Fan Theory Highlights

### Most Interesting Theories
1. **Noah as Flood Ark** - Noah will be used to evacuate Fish-Man Island when world floods
2. **Joy Boy's Failed War** - Joy Boy lost Void Century war, preventing promise fulfillment
3. **Luffy Fulfills Prophecy** - Luffy will help evacuate Fish-Man Island before Red Line destruction
4. **Vander Decken's Family Mission** - Not crazy, but completing generations-long quest for Poseidon

### Theory Connections to Episode 561
The falling Noah scene in this episode is central to multiple fan theories about:
- Joy Boy's promise
- Madam Shyarly's prophecy
- The future destruction/salvation of Fish-Man Island
- The role of Poseidon (Shirahoshi) in world events

## Final Notes

This research provides a comprehensive foundation for Episode 561 data. The episode is particularly significant as it:
- Showcases post-timeskip abilities of Straw Hat members
- Escalates the main conflict with Noah falling
- Demonstrates Energy Steroids' role in the arc
- Shows collaboration between Straw Hats and Neptune family
- Sets up the climactic resolution of the arc

The episode serves as a turning point where the main threat (Hody Jones) combines with a catastrophic secondary threat (falling Noah), raising stakes for the arc's conclusion.
