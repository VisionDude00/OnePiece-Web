# Research Notes - Episode 361

## Episode Title Wordplay
The Japanese title contains excellent wordplay: "ペローナ恐怖!!嘘のウはウソップのウ" (Perona Kyōfu!! Uso no U wa Usoppu no U)
- "Uso" (嘘) means "lie" or "falsehood" in Japanese
- The episode title emphasizes how the "U" sound in "Uso" (lie) is the same "U" in "Usopp"
- This connects Usopp's identity directly to deception and trickery, which is exactly how he wins

## Animation Quality Notes
According to the Adult Swim Squad recap, this episode had some animation issues:
- Facial expressions were occasionally off
- Some body proportion problems
- However, the character work and storytelling remained strong

## Key Parallels
The Usopp vs. Perona fight strongly parallels Luffy vs. Enel:
- Both feature opponents with seemingly invincible abilities
- Both are defeated by protagonists with natural immunity (Luffy's rubber vs. lightning, Usopp's negativity vs. negative ghosts)
- Both victories are achieved through inherent character traits rather than training or power-ups

## Technique Debuts
Three new Usopp techniques in this episode:
1. **Torimochi Boshi** (Birdlime Star) - Adhesive projectile
2. **Gokiburi Boshi** (Cockroach Star) - Psychological warfare with fake bugs
3. **Usopp Golden Pound** - Inflatable hammer for intimidation

Two new Perona techniques:
1. **Toku Hollow** (Special Hollow) - Giant ghost
2. **Kamikaze Rap** - Explosive ghost attack

## Continuity Notes
- Usopp uses the Impact Dial from Skypiea (episodes 195-197), showing excellent continuity
- This demonstrates that the Straw Hats keep and utilize equipment from previous arcs
- The Impact Dial was obtained during their time in Skypiea and Usopp has been saving it for the right moment

## Character Development
This is arguably one of Usopp's most impressive solo victories because:
- He defeats a Devil Fruit user without any Devil Fruit powers himself
- He causes no real physical harm - purely psychological warfare
- He demonstrates tactical intelligence by deducing Perona's weakness
- He plans multiple steps ahead, setting traps that pay off later

## No Ending Theme
Episode 361 had no ending theme, which has been standard since episode 279. The extended opening "Jungle P" by 5050 is used instead.

## Manga Adaptation
Covers Chapter 466 (pages 2-15), titled "Conclusion"
The anime extended some scenes for pacing and added more comedic reactions.

## Research Challenges
- Limited availability of full episode transcripts
- Some YouTube content and specific video analyses were difficult to locate
- Most analysis comes from written sources (blogs, wikis) rather than video content

## Voice Actor Notes
- Perona: Kumiko Nishihara (JP) / Felecia Angelle (EN)
- Usopp: Kappei Yamaguchi (JP) / Sonny Strait (EN)
- Both voice actors deliver excellent comedic timing in this episode

## Broadcast Information
- Japan: July 6, 2008
- US DVD: January 13, 2015
- US Toonami: September 17, 2016
- Nearly 8-year gap between Japanese and US Toonami broadcast
