- Significance: Treated as a character rather than just a location

### No Location Debuts
This episode takes place entirely at sea between Enies Lobby and Water 7.

2. **Gratitude and Appreciation**: Mutual thanks between ship and crew
3. **Memories and Legacy**: The importance of remembering those we've lost
4. **Acceptance and Moving Forward**: Learning to let go when something cannot be saved

## Animation and Music

- **Title**: "Crazy Rainbow"
- **Artist**: Tackey & Tsubasa
- **Episodes**: 284-325

### Ending Song
- **Title**: "Dear Friends"
- **Artist**: TRIPLANE

## Manga Differences

2. **Music Enhancement**: The use of "Dear Friends" during the funeral was an anime-original choice that significantly enhanced the emotional impact.

## Challenges and Blockers

### Successfully Addressed:
