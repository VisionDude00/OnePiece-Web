## Significance of Episode 571

This episode is **critically important** to the One Piece narrative for several reasons:

1. **First Emperor Introduction** - Big Mom is the first Yonko (Four Emperor) to be properly introduced in the series, establishing the power level and scope of threats in the New World.

2. **Luffy's Bold Declaration** - Luffy directly challenges a Yonko for the first time, showing his growth in ambition as he enters the New World. This sets up the entire Whole Cake Island arc.

3. **Character Foreshadowing** - Charlotte Pudding appears with her third eye visible, hundreds of episodes before it becomes a major plot point. This is masterful long-term storytelling.

4. **Mink Introduction** - Pekoms is the first mink character shown, foreshadowing the Zou arc and the Mink Tribe.

5. **Territory System** - Establishes how Yonko control the New World through protection rackets and tribute systems.

6. **Big Mom's Personality** - Her irrational obsession with sweets over treasure, her cruelty to her own crew, and her terrifying presence are all established in this single episode.
