    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Jaguar D. Saul survived the Buster Call despite being frozen by Kuzan (Aokiji). Evidence includes the 'D' in his name suggesting he has a significant role to play, and the fact that we never see his body completely destroyed. Some believe he may have been thawed out and could return later in the story to reunite with Robin.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Saul's lesson about laughing through hardship has deeper significance related to the Will of D. The mysterious 'D' clan members are often shown smiling or laughing in the face of death or adversity (like Roger's execution). Saul teaching Robin this philosophy may be connected to the true meaning of the D clan's legacy.",
