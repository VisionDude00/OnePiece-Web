2. **Timestamp Accuracy:** Timestamps are approximate based on episode summaries and reviews rather than direct episode viewing. They should be accurate within 30-60 seconds.

3. **External Media:** Limited number of dedicated episode 532 reviews found. Most coverage is part of arc-wide reviews or multi-episode reactions.

## Notable Findings

- Extended scene of axe traveling through water (anime addition)
- Zoro drinking and capture scene (anime original, not in Chapter 613)
- Longer introduction/recap format
- Extended dialogue in Minister of the Left scene

### Fan Reception
- Episode generally well-received despite slow pacing
- Some fans found it "filler-like" but appreciated character moments
- Shirahoshi's crying received mixed reactions (comedic vs annoying)
- Strong 4/5 rating from pokémasterkai blog review

### Foreshadowing
- Heavy foreshadowing of Shirahoshi's importance (later revealed as Ancient Weapon Poseidon)
- Alliance between Hody and Decken sets up main conflict
- Noah's introduction hints at ancient history significance
