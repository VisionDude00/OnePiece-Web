    "theoryText": "Many fans theorized after Shirahoshi's debut that she might be connected to the Ancient Weapon Poseidon, especially given the emphasis on her importance and the 10 years of threats from Vander Decken. The theory suggested that Poseidon wasn't a weapon or object, but rather a living being with the power to control Sea Kings, and that Shirahoshi was this weapon.",

Hody wanted to destroy Fish-Man Island and kill all humans, while Decken wanted to possess Shirahoshi (or kill her if he couldn't have her). Fans predicted that Decken's obsession with Shirahoshi would eventually conflict with Hody's plans, leading to betrayal.",
