    "theoryText": "The skull shape formed by Jaya and Skypiea when combined is not coincidental but represents a symbolic connection to the Ancient Kingdom and the Void Century. The skull motif appears repeatedly in One Piece (Jolly Rogers, Thriller Bark, etc.) and may indicate that the Ancient Kingdom's influence extended to both sea and sky.",

    "theoryText": "The concept of vearth (soil/earth) being sacred and fought over in the sky mirrors how those with the 'Will of D' bring change and upheaval wherever they go. Just as vearth doesn't naturally belong in the sky but creates conflict and growth when it arrives, the 'D' clan members bring earth-shaking changes to the world. The Shandia's 400-year quest to reclaim their vearth parallels the D clan's mysterious historical purpose.",

    "theoryText": "The specific mention of 'the Skull's Right Eye' as the location of the City of Gold may foreshadow connections to the Ancient Weapons. In many One Piece theories, eyes are symbolic of vision and knowledge. The right eye specifically pointing to Shandora (which contains poneglyphs) suggests that this location holds crucial information about the Ancient Weapons or Void Century.",
