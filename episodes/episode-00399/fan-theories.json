    "theoryText": "When the Pacifista first appeared in episode 399, many fans theorized that these weren't just robots designed to look like Kuma, but actual genetic clones of Bartholomew Kuma that were then cybernetically enhanced. This theory suggested that cloning would be more efficient and align with Vegapunk's 'Human Weapon Project' terminology. The theory was later confirmed in the manga when it was revealed that Pacifistas are indeed clones of Kuma enhanced with cybernetics.",

    "theoryText": "Following episode 399's promise between Luffy, Law, and Kid to meet in the New World, fans theorized that these three captains would recreate the structure of the previous generation's great pirates: Gol D. Roger, Edward Newgate (Whitebeard), and Golden Lion Shiki. The theory suggests Luffy parallels Roger (the Pirate King), Law parallels Whitebeard (protective and crew-focused), and Kid parallels Shiki (ambitious and ruthless). The three would divide the New World similar to how the previous generation did.",
