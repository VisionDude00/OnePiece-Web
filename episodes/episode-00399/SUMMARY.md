## What Happens

After the chaos inside the Human Auctioning House, Luffy, Trafalgar Law, and Eustass Kid emerge to face an encirclement of Marines. The three Supernova captains and their crews join forces to break through, showcasing their incredible Devil Fruit powers. Kid uses his magnetic abilities to create a massive metal arm for his Punk Gibson technique, while Law demonstrates his Room ability to surgically rearrange Marines' body parts. Law also frees Jean Bart from slavery and invites him to join the Heart Pirates.

After defeating the Marines, the three captains exchange words about their dreams and rivalry, promising to meet again in the New World. The Straw Hats escape with help from Duval and the Rosy Life Riders, while the Kid and Heart Pirates encounter a mysterious figure resembling Bartholomew Kuma that attacks them with laser beams - the first clear appearance of a Pacifista.

Meanwhile, at Shakky's bar, Silvers Rayleigh reveals shocking truths to the Straw Hats: he was Gol D. Roger's vice-captain and first mate, and Roger turned himself in to the Marines rather than being captured, having contracted a terminal illness four years before his execution.
