    "summary": "A theory that Jewelry Bonney has a familial connection to Bartholomew Kuma, explaining her emotional reaction when she later encounters him.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorized that Jewelry Bonney's connection to Bartholomew Kuma, hinted at in later episodes, was more than coincidental. The theory suggested that Bonney was Kuma's daughter, which would explain her deep emotional reactions to his fate and her determination to save him. This theory was later confirmed in the manga, revealing that while Bonney is not Kuma's biological daughter, she is his adopted daughter, and he sacrificed everything to save her life.",

He never expected them to become so important to the plotline. This explains why they were all introduced simultaneously in one episode rather than being gradually built up throughout the series. Despite being spontaneous creations, characters like Trafalgar Law, Eustass Kid, and Jewelry Bonney became central to future arcs.",

Unlike the other Supernovas who have played significant roles in major arcs (Law in Dressrosa and Wano, Kid in Wano, Bonney in Egghead, Bege in Whole Cake Island), Urouge has had minimal screen time and impact on the story since his introduction.
