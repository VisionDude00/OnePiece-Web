    "theory": "The revelation that Doflamingo killed all eight of Baby 5's fiancés and destroyed their hometowns raises questions about his motivations. Buffalo claims Doflamingo did this out of protective love, viewing Baby 5 as a sister and protecting her from exploitative suitors who took advantage of her psychological need to be needed. However, fans debate whether this is genuine protection or a form of manipulation and control that keeps Baby 5 dependent on Doflamingo and the crew, preventing her from having autonomy or relationships outside his influence.",
