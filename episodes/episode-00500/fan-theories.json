    "theory": "Sabo's survival was foreshadowed by Dragon's presence at Gray Terminal. Many fans theorized that when Dragon witnessed the Celestial Dragon shoot down Sabo's ship in Episode 503, he would rescue the boy. This theory was supported by Dragon appearing at Gray Terminal the same night carrying an unknown injured person. The lack of showing Sabo's body and only his hat floating reinforced the belief he survived.",
