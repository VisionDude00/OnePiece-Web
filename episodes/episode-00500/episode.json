Sterry acts respectfully in front of the parents but privately reveals his disdain for Sabo and his relief that the 'real son' stayed away.",

It reveals the complete moral bankruptcy of Goa Kingdom's ruling class and the systemic nature of the injustice.

The nobles and citizens of High Town are united in keeping it quiet to prevent outsiders from learning about it, treating the impending massacre as an acceptable inconvenience.",
      "significance": "This shows that the corruption isn't limited to a few nobles but is systemic throughout High Town's society. Everyone is complicit in the genocide through their silence and indifference. For Sabo, this is a final confirmation that the world he was born into is irredeemably corrupt and that he made the right choice in leaving.",
