    "theoryTitle": "Monet Survived the Heart Stabbing",
    "theoryText": "Monet may have survived Caesar's heart stabbing because the weapon Caesar used was shown lying on the ground away from her heart, not lodged inside it. This suggests Caesar only grazed her heart rather than fully penetrating it. Monet coughing blood and losing consciousness could have been due to the force applied to her weakened state after her battles with Zoro and Tashigi, not necessarily death. Oda has a history of not killing characters definitively, and Monet's 'death' scene was deliberately ambiguous.",

    "theoryTitle": "Law's Heart Switch Was Planned From the Beginning",
    "theoryText": "Law never trusted Caesar from the moment they formed their partnership and planned the heart-switching deception from day one. When Caesar demanded Law's heart in exchange for Monet's, Law saw this as an opportunity to create a failsafe. By keeping his own heart and returning Monet's to Caesar, Law ensured he couldn't be controlled or killed by Caesar. When Law later obtained Smoker's heart, he had two identical hearts and used this to his advantage. This theory suggests Law's entire plan on Punk Hazard was more elaborate than initially shown, with multiple layers of deception.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Donquixote Mjosgard's later appearance and redemption arc connects thematically to the events of Punk Hazard, particularly Monet's potential survival. If Monet survived and Mjosgard (a reformed Celestial Dragon) could play a role in her redemption or reveal information about the Donquixote family. This theory suggests Oda planted seeds for future storylines involving reformed Donquixote family members.",

    "theoryText": "The debut of Doflamingo's Sora no Michi (Sky Path) technique in this episode foreshadows his later Devil Fruit awakening. The ability to attach strings to clouds and manipulate them shows early signs of affecting the environment beyond his own body. Fans theorize this was Oda's way of gradually introducing the concept of Paramecia awakening, where users can affect their surroundings. The limitation of needing clouds also sets up strategic counters that Law later exploits.",
