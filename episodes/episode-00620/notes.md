## Notable Challenges & Limitations

### Missing Information
1. **Episode Script**: Could not locate a full transcript of the episode. Relied on wiki summaries, manga chapter, and video descriptions.
2. **Precise Timestamps**: Estimated timestamps based on typical episode structure and event sequencing. Actual timestamps may vary by ±30 seconds.
3. **YouTube Reactions**: Limited YouTube content found. Most reactions were on alternative platforms or covered multiple episodes.
4. **Voice Actor Credits**: Could not verify all minor character voice actors for this specific episode.

### Research Blockers
1. **No Direct Script Access**: Episode scripts not publicly available for Episode 620
2. **Limited Episode-Specific Content**: Most external media covered episode ranges (620-622) rather than 620 alone
3. **Ending Song**: Confirmed Episode 620 had no ending theme (episodes 279-1070 had no endings)

### Ambiguities Requiring Further Review
1. **Monet's Status**: Listed as "UNKNOWN" rather than "DEAD" due to ongoing fan debate and ambiguous visual evidence
2. **Exact Animation Quality**: Listed as "STANDARD" - could not verify if any sakuga moments were present
3. **Complete Voice Actor List**: Only major character voice actors included; background characters not verified

- **Reason**: Heart stabbed by Caesar, but survival debated by community
- **Evidence for Death**: Blood from mouth, stopped movement, symbolic imagery
- **Evidence for Survival**: Weapon shown on ground (not in heart), Oda's history of character survival, ambiguous staging

### Punk Hazard Laboratory
- **Previous Status**: ACTIVE (facility operational)
- **New Status**: DESTROYED (structural collapse and explosion)
- **Timing**: Episode 620 (ongoing destruction from Episode 619)

## Final Notes

Episode 620 represents a critical turning point in the Punk Hazard arc, where Law's strategic brilliance is revealed and Doflamingo becomes a direct threat. The episode balances multiple storylines (laboratory escape, tanker battle, Dressrosa scenes) while advancing the plot significantly. Monet's ambiguous fate has become one of the series' most discussed character moments, demonstrating the episode's lasting impact on the fanbase.

The research process was successful despite the lack of a full episode script. Multiple sources were cross-referenced to ensure accuracy, and all major events, character moments, and story beats were documented. The episode's themes of deception, loyalty, and escalating conflict are well-represented in the data collected.
