    "theoryText": "Before episode 547, some viewers theorized that Hody Jones, not the human pirate, was the real killer of Queen Otohime. The theory was based on Hody's suspicious behavior, his extreme anti-human hatred, and the lack of motive for a random human pirate to kill Otohime. Viewers speculated that Hody either paid the pirate to do it or threatened him, then killed the pirate to cover his tracks and frame humans for the assassination.",

    "theoryText": "Viewers theorized that the human pirate shown by Hody Jones was paid or coerced to burn the box of signatures for Otohime's petition. The theory suggested that Hody orchestrated both the signature burning and Otohime's assassination, using the human as a scapegoat to maximize anti-human sentiment. The lack of clear motive for the human to act independently suggested he was being used as a pawn in a larger conspiracy.",

The theory suggested that Jinbe needed to resolve his guilt over Arlong before he could truly become part of Luffy's crew, and Nami's forgiveness lifted that burden. Fans noted that every Straw Hat member had an emotional moment of acceptance before joining, and this could be Jinbe's.",
