    "theory": "Gin's promise to meet Luffy again on the Grand Line was a setup for his eventual return. Fans theorized for years that Gin would reappear in the story, possibly as an ally or reformed pirate. This theory was confirmed in manga chapter 1117 when Gin returned, having survived and made it to the New World.",

    "theory": "When Nami mentioned Bell-mère while crying on the Going Merry, fans immediately theorized that she had a tragic backstory involving this person. The emotional weight of the scene suggested Bell-mère was likely deceased and that Nami's need for freedom was connected to some form of oppression or obligation. This theory was proven correct in the Arlong Park Arc.",

    "theory": "Fans noted that Krieg's complete mental breakdown after defeat revealed that his 'strength' was built entirely on his weapons and reputation, not genuine combat skill or mental fortitude. This established a pattern in One Piece where early East Blue villains who rely on tricks and equipment are shown to be fundamentally weaker than those who develop their own strength.",
