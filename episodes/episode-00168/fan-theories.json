    "theoryText": "The Skypiea Arc serves as a microcosm and foreshadowing of the final war in One Piece. The conflict between the Shandia (original inhabitants fighting for their homeland), Sky Islanders (current inhabitants), and Enel (tyrannical god figure) mirrors the larger conflict between the Ancient Kingdom, World Government, and Celestial Dragons. The resolution in Skypiea - where Luffy defeats the 'god' and helps restore the land to its rightful people while uniting factions - foreshadows how the final war may conclude.",

    "theoryTitle": "Nola's Emotional Intelligence and the Bell",
    "theoryText": "Nola's reaction to the Golden Bell suggests that ancient creatures in One Piece possess far greater emotional intelligence and memory than typical animals. The theory suggests that Nola has been waiting 400 years to hear the bell again because it represents the friendship with Noland and Kalgara. This could indicate that other ancient creatures (like the Sea Kings and Zunesha) also have deep emotional connections to historical events and may play crucial roles in the endgame.",

Some theorists suggest that the Shandia may have historical connections to the Ancient Kingdom, and their role as protectors of Shandora's Poneglyph wasn't coincidental but part of a larger responsibility passed down through generations, similar to how the D. Clan carries mysterious inherited will.",
