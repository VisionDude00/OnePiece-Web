    "title": "Dr. Hiriluk is Rocks D. Xebec Theory",
    "theoryText": "A theory suggesting that Rocks D. Xebec survived the God Valley Incident and later became Dr. Hiriluk. The timeline evidence includes: Hiriluk had his life-changing experience 38 years before his death when he saw cherry blossoms, which aligns with the God Valley incident timeline. He then spent 30 years working on his miracle medicine. The cherry blossoms he saw were in 'a faraway land in the West,' and Chapter 1095 confirmed God Valley was in the West Blue. This would explain how Dr. Kureha knew about the Will of D - Hiriluk told her. The theory suggests Rocks changed his ways after God Valley and became a doctor trying to help people.",

    "theoryText": "A theory proposing that the island where Hiriluk witnessed the miracle cherry blossoms that changed his life was actually God Valley. This would connect Hiriluk's backstory to one of the most significant events in One Piece history. The theory is supported by the timeline matching up and the location being in the West Blue. Some theorists suggest this experience on God Valley fundamentally changed Hiriluk's worldview, leading him to dedicate his life to healing hearts rather than pursuing power or violence.",

    "title": "Cherry Blossoms as Symbol of Liberation",
    "theoryText": "A thematic theory suggesting that cherry blossoms in One Piece consistently represent liberation and revolution. Hiriluk's dream of bringing cherry blossoms to Drum Island was about liberating the people's frozen hearts from despair and tyranny. This theme appears throughout the series, with cherry blossoms symbolizing freedom, renewal, and the breaking of chains (both literal and metaphorical). The theory proposes that Oda uses sakura imagery deliberately to foreshadow moments of liberation, making the Drum Island scene in Episode 90 a microcosm of the series' larger themes about freedom.",

    "theoryText": "The theory that Hiriluk's famous line 'When do you think people die? It's when they are forgotten' is major foreshadowing for the series endgame. This philosophy about death and memory connects to the Will of D, the Void Century, and the true nature of immortality in One Piece. The theory suggests that the final villain will attempt to be 'remembered forever' through tyranny, while Luffy will counter this by creating a world where people are remembered for bringing freedom and joy. The cherry blossoms in Episode 90 represent this - Hiriluk lives on through memories, dreams, and the impact he had on others, particularly Chopper.",
