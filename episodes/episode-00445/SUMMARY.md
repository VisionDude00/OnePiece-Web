## Episode Summary

Episode 445 depicts a critical convergence of events within Impel Down as two separate invasions unfold simultaneously. Luffy's escape attempt reaches Level 4, where he, Jinbe, and Crocodile face the three Jailer Beasts (Minokoala, Minorhinoceros, and Minozebra), defeating them with single strikes each. Meanwhile, Buggy and Mr. 3 become trapped on Level 2 by Magellan's poison barrier.

The episode's pivotal moment occurs on Level 1, where Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard) and his crew infiltrate Impel Down. There, Shiryu of the Rain - the former Head Jailer released from Level 6 to help quell the riot - confronts Blackbeard. Rather than fighting, the two engage in conversation, establishing a relationship that will have world-changing consequences.

On Level 4, Vice Warden Hannyabal receives orders from Magellan to stop the escapees. Emporio Ivankov stays behind to battle Sadi, allowing Luffy to proceed forward, where he encounters Hannyabal preparing to fight.
