## Key Significance
This episode is extremely significant for several reasons:

1. **First Visual Armament Haki**: Episode 525 marks the first time Armament Haki's hardening effect is shown visually in the anime with the iconic black coloring. This establishes a fundamental visual language for the rest of the series.

2. **Post-Timeskip Power Showcase**: The Monster Trio each demonstrate major new techniques learned during the two-year training period:
   - Luffy: Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun with Armament Haki
   - Zoro: Santoryu Ogi: Rokudo no Tsuji
   - Sanji: Blue Walk and Diable Jambe: Bien Cuit

3. **Character Debuts**: Four new characters/creatures debut:
   - Wadatsumi (giant fish-man)
   - Vander Decken IX (silhouette)
   - Megalo (shark)
   - Surume/Kraken (named after being tamed)

## Manga Differences

2. Anime includes flashback scenes of Zoro and Sanji's training not shown at this point in the manga
