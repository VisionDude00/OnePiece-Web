The fact that 'simple-minded' people like Luffy are more vulnerable, while strong-willed individuals could resist, may be early foreshadowing of Conqueror's Haki and the importance of willpower that becomes central to the series later.",

She completely neutralizes Luffy—the strongest fighter present—without throwing a single punch. This demonstrates that in One Piece, raw power isn't everything, and that creative abilities and tactics can be more valuable than strength.",

    "theoryText": "If Colors Trap works on someone as strong-willed as Luffy (even if he is 'simple-minded'), it could theoretically work on almost anyone in the East Blue and early Grand Line. The only reason it isn't overpowered is because it requires the target to be marked with paint, which is difficult in active combat. This makes Miss Goldenweek a support fighter who needs teammates to hold enemies still.",
