    "summary": "The theory that Aokiji spares Luffy and the Straw Hats in episode 227 because he owes a debt to Luffy's grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, who was his mentor.",
    "fullText": "When Aokiji mentions Luffy's grandfather in episode 227, fans theorized this wasn't just casual observation but the key reason why he didn't kill the Straw Hats despite claiming he should.

Fans theorized that Aokiji was present during the Ohara Buster Call 20 years ago and played a role in Robin's survival. This theory was later confirmed when it was revealed Aokiji helped Robin escape Ohara by providing a small boat and ice trail, despite being ordered to kill all Ohara survivors, doing so to honor his friend Jaguar D. Saul's dying wish.",

The theory suggests Aokiji may have had a relationship with someone from Ohara, possibly Robin's mother or another scholar, which would explain his conflicted behavior toward Robin throughout the series.",

    "fullText": "Aokiji's contradictory behavior in episode 227 - claiming he should kill the Straw Hats but not following through, helping civilians while hunting pirates - led fans to theorize about the origin of his 'Lazy Justice' philosophy. The theory suggests that witnessing the Ohara Buster Call and being forced to participate in the genocide of innocent scholars caused Aokiji to question the Marines' absolute justice. His lazy demeanor and reluctance to act may be a defense mechanism against the moral conflicts he faces as a Marine Admiral.",

This color theory extended to their Devil Fruit powers and personalities, with ice being defensive, magma being offensive, and light being speed-based.",
