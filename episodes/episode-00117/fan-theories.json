    "summary": "Theory that Pluton is actually a construction ship capable of moving entire landmasses, not just destroying them.",
    "fullText": "A popular theory proposes that Pluton is a land displacement machine with the ability to remove land from somewhere and take it to somewhere else. The destructive power is not Pluton's purpose by itself, but rather part of the larger process of deconstructing landmass, storing it, transporting it and reconstructing it in a new location. This would explain why it's called a 'battleship' but is actually something far more sophisticated than just a weapon.",

    "fullText": "This theory proposes that Pluton might not be a physical warship at all, but rather a person who possesses special abilities like the voice of all things. Just as Poseidon turned out to be Princess Shirahoshi with the power to command Sea Kings, Pluton could be someone like Momonosuke who can control Zunesha. The 'weapon' beneath Wano might actually be battle armor or a vehicle for Zunesha or another ancient creature. This would explain the parallel naming structure with Poseidon and why the Ancient Weapons are so carefully guarded as secrets.",

    "fullText": "Crocodile explicitly states in episode 117 that he needs Pluton to 'establish military power and counter the World Government forces.' This reveals that his ambitions extended far beyond just ruling Arabasta - he wanted to challenge the entire world order. The theory suggests that Crocodile may have had personal grievances against the World Government, possibly related to his mysterious past or potential encounters with Celestial Dragons. His plan to acquire an Ancient Weapon shows he was willing to go to extreme lengths to gain power that could rival the government itself. This adds depth to his character as more than just a typical villain seeking a kingdom.",

    "fullText": "The Clima-Tact's introduction in episode 117 demonstrates a key theme in One Piece: what appears to be magic is often just advanced science or knowledge. Usopp designed the weapon with meteorological principles, but to most observers, Nami's weather manipulation seems impossible or magical. This parallels how Devil Fruits and other 'powers' in the One Piece world might have scientific explanations. The weapon is essentially useless to anyone without Nami's extensive meteorological knowledge, showing that intelligence and education can be as powerful as superhuman abilities. This theme continues throughout the series with Vegapunk's technology and other scientific advancements that seem magical.",
