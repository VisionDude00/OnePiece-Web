    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Apis's Devil Fruit ability to communicate with animals could have been a subtle foreshadowing of future important animal-related plot points in One Piece.",
    "fullText": "While the Warship Island Arc is filler, some fans have speculated that the introduction of the Hiso Hiso no Mi (Whisper-Whisper Fruit) could have been intended to plant seeds for later canonical plot developments involving animal communication. Though Apis never returns to the main story, her ability to speak with dragons and other animals mirrors some themes that appear later in the series with characters like Chopper and the concept of 'hearing the voice of all things.'",

    "summary": "Fans discuss why Eiichiro Oda specifically praised the Warship Island Arc when he rarely comments on anime filler content.",
    "fullText": "The Warship Island Arc is notable as one of the only filler arcs that Eiichiro Oda publicly commented on and praised in Weekly Shonen Jump. Fans theorize several reasons for this: the arc's themes align well with One Piece's overall message about dreams and protection; it provides a natural transition point before entering the Grand Line; the dragon mythology could have resonated with Oda's own plans for dragons in the series; or the arc may have explored ideas Oda himself had considered but never had space to develop in the manga.",
