    "theoryTitle": "Shanks Lost His Arm to Escape Imu's Control",
    "theoryText": "Based on revelations in One Piece Chapter 1152, fans theorize that Shanks didn't just lose his arm saving Luffy - he deliberately sacrificed it to free himself from the World Government's control. The theory suggests that Shanks had a mark (the 'Abyss mark') on his left arm granted by Imu, which allowed Imu to summon and control him at will. When the opportunity arose to save Luffy, Shanks willingly lost his marked arm, severing his connection to the Figarland family and Imu's influence. This recontextualizes the sacrifice: saving Luffy was genuine, but it also gave Shanks the perfect opportunity to gain his freedom. This explains why Shanks is so grateful to Luffy and why he 'bet his arm on the new era.'",

    "theoryTitle": "Shanks Could Have Saved His Arm But Chose Not To",
    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Shanks, as one of the most powerful pirates in the world with mastery of all three types of Haki, could have easily defeated the Lord of the Coast without losing his arm. The theory suggests Shanks deliberately chose to lose his arm as a symbolic gesture - investing in Luffy's future and the new generation of pirates. By making such a dramatic sacrifice, Shanks ensured Luffy would understand the weight of dreams and the price people pay for them. Some versions of this theory suggest Shanks foresaw Luffy's potential (possibly through advanced Observation Haki) and made a calculated investment in the future Pirate King.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Lord of the Coast - the Sea King that ate Higuma and took Shanks' arm - will have significance later in the series. Theories range from it being connected to the ancient weapons (since Sea Kings can communicate and are tied to Poseidon) to it potentially recognizing Luffy when he returns to Foosha Village as a legendary pirate. The most popular version suggests the Sea King witnessed something important about Luffy or Shanks that day and may serve as a witness or catalyst for future revelations about their connection.",

However, his editor suggested that having Shanks sacrifice his arm would make the story more emotionally impactful and exciting.
