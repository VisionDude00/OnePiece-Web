    "theoryText": "In Chapter 699 (which Episode 621 adapts), fans noticed that the shading in Kuzan's glasses briefly resembles Imu before Doflamingo asks where he stands and what he is. Combined with Chapter 1121's revelation that Kuzan plays an enormous role in the endgame, fans theorize that Kuzan's true target is Imu, the secret ruler of the world.",

This would explain why a former Marine Admiral with a sense of justice would join a pirate crew, and why Akainu brushed off the Gorosei's comments about Aokiji joining Blackbeard.",
