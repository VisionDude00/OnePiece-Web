In the original manga cover story, Sanji was only forced to disguise himself or wear okama clothing but was never fully transformed psychologically. This anime-only scene was added for comedic effect but contradicts the manga's portrayal of Sanji's character during the separation.",

    "theory": "The transformation technique used by Caroline on Sanji is a psychological attack unique to Newkama Kenpo masters. It works by forcing opponents to question their identity and self-perception, making it more of a mental defeat than a physical one. This explains why Sanji was 'converted' rather than simply defeated - the technique specifically targets one's sense of self.",
