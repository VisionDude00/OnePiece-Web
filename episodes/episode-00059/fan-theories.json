    "summary": "Some fans theorize that the Sennenryu dragons from the Warship Island Arc could be related to ancient weapons or the Ancient Kingdom, even though the arc is filler.",
    "fullText": "Despite being filler content, some fans have theorized that the Sennenryu dragons could have been inspired by or connected to larger One Piece lore. The dragons' 1000-year lifespan, their mystical properties, and the fact that they were hunted by the Marines for their power-granting bones parallel themes seen with Ancient Weapons and the Void Century. While this arc is non-canon, fans speculate that Oda may have provided some input on dragon mythology that could appear in canon material later.",

    "fullText": "Eric's Kama Kama no Mi allows him to create razor-sharp wind slashes, which is very similar to the Rokushiki technique Rankyaku that CP9 uses later in the series. Fans theorize that either: 1) The anime staff may have been given advance information about Rankyaku and created Eric's power as a filler version, or 2) Oda saw Eric's power in the anime and it influenced his design of Rankyaku. The timing of the episodes and manga chapters makes this connection interesting to explore.",

Nelson's extreme obesity and immobility could also symbolize the moral stagnation within parts of the Marine organization.",

They argue the anime staff knew where Zoro's character was heading and wanted to subtly foreshadow his future growth. Others suggest it shows Zoro always had the potential but needed to truly understand the 'breath of all things' to do it consistently. However, most agree this is likely just an oversight by the filler episode writers who weren't carefully tracking Zoro's canonical power progression.",
