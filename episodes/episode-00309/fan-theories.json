    "theory": "Luffy's incredible willpower displayed in episode 309, where he stands up despite being devastated by Lucci's Rokuogan, is an early foreshadowing of his Conqueror's Haki ability. His refusal to fall and determination to save Robin represents the 'will to overpower others' that would later be formally introduced as Haoshoku Haki. Some fans believe this moment was Oda subtly showing Luffy's Supreme King potential before the concept was explicitly introduced.",

    "notes": "While not explicitly confirmed that this specific moment was Conqueror's Haki, Luffy's exceptional willpower in this fight is frequently cited as an early demonstration of the qualities associated with Supreme King Haki before the concept was formally introduced. The Loguetown novel mentioned Luffy having the 'Countenance of a Supreme King,' suggesting Oda planned this trait early.",

    "theory": "The destruction of Yubashiri in episode 309 was deliberate foreshadowing by Oda for Zoro to eventually acquire Shusui from Ryuma in the Thriller Bark arc. Some fans theorize that Oda needed to destroy one of Zoro's swords to create narrative space for the legendary black blade Shusui, which would become crucial to Zoro's character development and the Wano arc storyline.",

    "notes": "This theory has been essentially confirmed as Zoro did replace Yubashiri with Shusui after the Thriller Bark arc. The destruction of Yubashiri created the narrative need for a replacement, which led to the significant plot point of Zoro acquiring and later returning a national treasure of Wano.",

    "theory": "The debut of Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling in episode 309 established a pattern for Luffy's power progression throughout the series. Fans theorize that Oda intentionally made this Luffy's first 'ultimate finishing move' that combines his Devil Fruit creativity with enhanced physical abilities, setting a template that would be repeated with Kong Gun, King Kong Gun, and eventually Bajrang Gun. Each major arc would feature Luffy developing a new 'ultimate' version of his barrage attacks.",
