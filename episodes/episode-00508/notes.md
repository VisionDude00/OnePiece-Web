- **Arc:** Post-War Arc

- **Manga Chapters Covered:** Chapter 592 (pages 8-15)

## Research Process

### Step 1: Episode Information Gathering
- Successfully found comprehensive episode details from One Piece Wiki
- Confirmed episode title, air dates, arc, and saga information
- Located production credits (animation director, screenplay, art direction, etc.)
- Identified opening song: "Fight Together" by Namie Amuro (Episodes 493-516)
- Confirmed no ending song (ending themes stopped from episode 279-1070)

### Step 2: Plot Summary Research
The episode follows three parallel storylines:

1. **Luffy at Amazon Lily:** Contemplates Rayleigh's training proposal vs. his promise to reunite with the crew in 3 days
2. **Nami on Weatheria:** Emotional breakdown about Ace's death, attempts to escape by taking Haredas hostage
3. **Franky on Karakuri Island:** Discovers Vegapunk's laboratory, accidentally triggers massive explosion creating the "Nightmare of Baldimore"

### Step 3: Character Research
**Characters with key moments in this episode:**
- Luffy (internal conflict, decision-making)
- Nami (emotional breakdown, escape attempt)
- Franky (laboratory discovery, explosion)
- Rayleigh (training proposal)
- Haredas (taken hostage)
- Kitton (directs Franky to laboratory)
- Boa Hancock (supporting Luffy)
- Jinbe (mentioned in episode)

### Step 4: Location Research
**Key Locations:**
- Amazon Lily (Luffy's story)
- Weatheria (Nami's story)
- Karakuri Island/Baldimore (Franky's story)
- Vegapunk's Laboratory (debuts and is destroyed in this episode)

### Step 5: External Media Search
Found the following external content:
- 2 Bilibili reaction videos covering episodes 506-508 and 507-508
- 1 TikTok video highlighting emotional moments
- Multiple articles analyzing the timeskip, Nami's emotional scene, and Vegapunk connection
- No dedicated Reddit discussion thread found (episode aired in 2011, before regular episode discussions)

### Step 6: Fan Theories
**Finding:** No specific fan theories found for Episode 508
- Searched Reddit, YouTube, forums
- Most fan theory content focuses on later revelations about Vegapunk, the timeskip's outcome, and Luffy's training
- Episode 508 is more of a transitional episode setting up future events rather than containing theory-worthy mysteries

### Step 7: Event Documentation
Created 8 distinct events:
1. Luffy struggles with Rayleigh's proposal (ep508-event-001)
2. Nami's emotional breakdown (ep508-event-002)
3. Nami's escape attempt (ep508-event-003)
4. Franky seeks help from Kitton (ep508-event-004)
5. Franky discovers Vegapunk's laboratory (ep508-event-005)
6. The Nightmare of Baldimore begins (ep508-event-006)
7. News of Nightmare spreads globally (ep508-event-007)
8. Hancock's concern for Luffy (ep508-event-008)

## Important Findings

### The Nightmare of Baldimore
- Globally significant incident caused by Franky
- Destroyed much of Vegapunk's research
- Paradoxically gave Franky access to hidden blueprints
- Became known worldwide
- Second instance in One Piece of someone mistaking a danger symbol for a pirate emblem (first was Chopper with poisonous mushroom)

### Emotional Core
- Nami's breakdown is the emotional centerpiece
- Shows how Ace's death affected all Straw Hats
- Demonstrates crew bonds despite physical separation
- Sets up Nami's eventual decision to stay and train

### Timeskip Setup
- This episode is part of the crucial setup for the 2-year timeskip
- Shows each Straw Hat facing challenges that will lead to training
- Luffy's indecision will resolve in Episode 511-516

## Blockers & Questions

### Timestamp Precision
**Issue:** Unable to find exact timestamps for all events
**Solution:** Used approximate timestamps based on episode structure and typical pacing
- Opening/recap: 0:00-2:30
- First story segment: ~3:00-7:00
- Second segment: ~8:00-14:00
- Third segment: ~15:00-22:00

**Note:** These are estimates. Actual viewing of the episode would provide exact timestamps.

### Voice Actor Information
**Found:** Japanese and English voice actors for main characters
**Limitation:** Some minor characters (Kitton, Kitton's grandfather) may not have complete voice actor credits

### Episode Script
**Issue:** Could not locate a complete line-by-line script
**Workaround:** Used detailed plot summaries from One Piece Wiki and other sources
**Impact:** Quotes are based on summaries rather than exact transcripts

### Fan Theories
**Issue:** No specific fan theories found for this particular episode
**Explanation:** Episode 508 is transitional/setup rather than revelation-heavy
**Note:** Broader timeskip theories exist but aren't specific to this episode

## Final Notes

This episode is a crucial transitional piece in the One Piece narrative. While it doesn't contain major revelations or debuts, it serves the critical function of:
1. Setting up the 2-year timeskip
2. Showing the emotional impact of Ace's death on all crew members
3. Establishing the circumstances that will lead each Straw Hat to train
4. Creating the Nightmare of Baldimore, a globally significant event

The parallel structure (three storylines) effectively shows the crew's separation while maintaining narrative momentum toward the eventual reunion.
