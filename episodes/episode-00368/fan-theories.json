    "theoryText": "When Kuma asked Nami about Luffy having a brother, he was verifying secret information he already possessed. Kuma knew that Portgas D. Ace and Monkey D. Dragon are Luffy's adoptive brother and biological father, respectively - both relationships were not public matters. As a Revolutionary Army officer, Kuma was confirming intelligence about Dragon's son and his connections before deciding how to handle the situation at Thriller Bark.",

    "theoryText": "As an undercover Revolutionary Army member, Kuma couldn't openly refuse to kill Luffy without blowing his cover with the World Government. Instead, he pretended to fight the Straw Hats, which gave him a chance to test the crew's loyalty and evaluate their potential. His question about Ace was part of gathering intelligence to determine if this crew was worth protecting. After witnessing Zoro's sacrifice later in the arc, Kuma mused about Dragon having a good son with a loyal crew, revealing he knew all along about Luffy's lineage and was evaluating whether they lived up to Dragon's legacy.",

    "theoryText": "When Kuma asked Perona where she would like to go, she described wanting 'a dark, damp island with an old castle filled with malice.' Kuma sent her exactly to what she described - Kuraigana Island with its spooky ruins and Mihawk's castle. Some fans theorize this was simple kindness from Kuma, fulfilling her wish. However, deeper theories suggest he may have been protecting her by sending her to a place where fellow Warlord Mihawk could keep her safe, or that he was reminded of his daughter Bonney due to Perona's pink hair and outgoing attitude, triggering fatherly protective instincts.",
