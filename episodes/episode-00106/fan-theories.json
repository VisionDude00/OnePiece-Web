    "theory": "The most popular theory suggests that Crocodile was assigned female at birth, and Emporio Ivankov used the powers of the Horm-Horm Fruit to change Crocodile's sex from female to male. This secret is what Ivankov holds over Crocodile during the Impel Down arc, allowing Ivankov to keep Crocodile in line by threatening to reveal this information. This theory is often referred to as the 'Croco-mom' theory among fans.",

    "theory": "Pell's survival of the bomb explosion in Alabasta has spawned multiple theories. The main explanations include: (1) Pell threw the bomb upward and dove down at falcon speed (over 300 km/h) to escape the blast radius, though he was still caught in the explosion; (2) He got as high as he could fly safely, tossed the bomb higher, and plummeted simultaneously; (3) Some fans believe Oda intentionally avoided deaths before Marineford to make Ace and Whitebeard's deaths more impactful. The official explanation is that Pell survived and was treated by Potsun at a remote hospital in the desert.",

    "theory": "This is more of a critical analysis than a mystery theory. Fans widely discuss why Crocodile is considered one of the best, if not THE best, villain in One Piece. Arguments include: his intelligence and complex multi-layered plan, being one of the few villains to actually defeat Luffy (multiple times), his ruthlessness in manipulating an entire country to destroy itself, his character design and memorable abilities, and his lasting impact on the series even after his arc concluded. Many compare him favorably to later villains like Doflamingo, arguing that Crocodile was 'Oda's most effective antagonist.'",
