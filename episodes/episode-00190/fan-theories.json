    "theoryText": "The visual presentation of Enel's Raigo attack in Episode 190 deliberately evokes atomic bomb imagery, with the mushroom cloud and complete obliteration of Angel Island serving as a powerful anti-war message. This symbolism would be particularly resonant with Japanese audiences who experienced Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The portrayal suggests Oda's commentary on the devastating consequences of weapons of mass destruction and the horror of warfare that claims countless innocent lives.",

This theory is supported by Dragon's unique facial tattoos, which are only shared by Shandian characters like Kalgara and Wyper in the series. If true, Dragon's animosity toward the World Government could be connected to his Shandian heritage and their historical persecution. This would also create a thematic connection between Luffy ringing the Golden Bell in Episode 190's arc and his family's ancestral ties to the Shandians.",

    "theoryText": "The Skypiea arc, including events in Episode 190, contains crucial foreshadowing of Sun God Nika, which was revealed nearly two decades later. The Shandians worship the sun god, and the arc introduces concepts that would become central to understanding Luffy's true Devil Fruit nature. The emphasis on the Golden Bell ringing and bringing light/hope to the world parallels Nika's role as a liberator. Some theorists suggest that if Zoan Devil Fruits have a will of their own (as later revealed), the Nika fruit might have been drawn to someone with potential Shandian heritage, connecting to the Dragon theory.",

    "theoryText": "The Golden Bell in the Skypiea arc (prominently featured in Episode 190's climax setup) serves as a metaphor for how historical truth can be buried but never truly destroyed. Luffy's determination to ring the bell represents truth and history inevitably resurfacing despite attempts to suppress them. This parallels the larger One Piece narrative about the Void Century and the World Government's suppression of true history. The bell's sound carrying across the ocean to Cricket proves that truth reaches those who need to hear it, no matter how much time has passed or how far apart they are.",
