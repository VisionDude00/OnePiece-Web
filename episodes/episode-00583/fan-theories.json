    "summary": "A theory that Trafalgar Law genuinely didn't know about Caesar's experiments on children during his time on Punk Hazard, despite spending months on the island.",
    "fullText": "According to this theory, Law had to agree not to be nosey about Caesar's research in exchange for being allowed to stay on the island. This would explain why Law, who has shown disgust at harming children, didn't intervene earlier. When Law discovers the truth about the children, his reaction suggests genuine surprise and horror. This theory is supported by Law's character development and his eventual alliance with the Straw Hats to stop Caesar's operations.",

    "summary": "The gigantified children in Punk Hazard were part of research commissioned by Big Mom to create artificial giants for her family.",
    "fullText": "This theory, which was later confirmed in the story, suggests that Caesar's cruel experiments on the children were funded and requested by Big Mom (Charlotte Linlin), who wanted to create artificial giants to add to her family and increase their combat power. The connection between Punk Hazard, Caesar's research, and Big Mom's ambitions reveals a larger conspiracy involving multiple powerful figures in the New World. This explains why Caesar was so invested in perfecting the gigantification process despite its horrific effects on the children.",

    "fullText": "This theory suggests that Law strategically positioned himself on Punk Hazard knowing it was a key part of Doflamingo's illegal operations. By disrupting Caesar's SAD production (which is needed to make SMILE fruits for Doflamingo's deal with Kaido), Law could both weaken Doflamingo and create an opportunity for revenge. Law's alliance with the Straw Hats to take down Caesar is actually the first step in a larger plan to destroy Doflamingo's criminal empire. The theory is supported by Law's knowledge of the island's operations and his strategic thinking throughout the arc.",

    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that Caesar's gigantification experiments on Punk Hazard are not entirely his own creation, but rather attempts to recreate or understand ancient technology or science from the Void Century. The theory points to the existence of natural giants in the One Piece world and suggests that the Ancient Kingdom may have had advanced knowledge of gigantification that has been lost to time. Vegapunk and Caesar's research could be attempts to rediscover this lost science. This would explain why the World Government is interested in the research despite its unethical nature.",
