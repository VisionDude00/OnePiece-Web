    "theoryText": "The revelation that Blackbeard became a Warlord connects to a popular fan theory that Blackbeard possesses a Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit called the Dog-Dog Fruit: Model Cerberus. This theory suggests that like the mythical Cerberus with three independent heads, Blackbeard can use more than one Devil Fruit power. This would explain his unique ability to wield both the Dark-Dark Fruit and later Whitebeard's Tremor-Tremor Fruit.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Blackbeard is not just one person but multiple people inhabiting one body, with the main theory being that Blackbeard's body consists of 3 distinct individuals. This would explain various anomalies about his character, including his ability to have multiple Devil Fruits and comments from other characters about his 'unusual body structure.' This theory gained traction after the revelation in Episode 369 that he captured Ace and became a Warlord, showing his rapid rise to power.",

Some fans theorize that Kuma already had knowledge of the Revolutionary Army's interest in the Straw Hats (due to Luffy being Dragon's son) and his visit was partially to assess the crew himself. This theory suggests Kuma's later decision to save the Straw Hats by sending them to safe locations was premeditated, not spontaneous.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 369 reveals Blackbeard became a Warlord after capturing Ace. Fan discussions theorize that Blackbeard deliberately planned to capture a high-value target to gain Warlord status, giving him access to Impel Down and eventually Marineford. Some theorists suggest Blackbeard's original plan wasn't specifically to capture Ace, but to capture any high-profile pirate that would grant him Warlord membership. Encountering Ace on Banaro Island was fortuitous but not the original target.",
