3. **Sabo/Ace Parallel** - Thematic connection between Sabo's apparent death and Ace's actual death

## Blockers and Limitations

### Script Access
**Issue:** Could not access full episode transcript/script.
**Impact:** Had to rely on wiki summaries and reviews for specific dialogue quotes. Only a few key quotes could be verified.
**Workaround:** Used multiple sources (One Piece Wiki, reviews, forums) to cross-reference plot points and character moments. Estimated timestamps based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions.

### Timestamp Accuracy
**Issue:** Without direct episode viewing or detailed script, timestamps are estimates.
**Status:** All timestamps in episode.json are approximate estimates based on:
- Typical One Piece episode structure (recap, opening, main content, preview)
- Event sequence described in sources
- Standard pacing for emotional scenes
**Recommendation:** Timestamps should be verified against actual episode viewing if possible.

### Voice Actor Information
**Issue:** Could not verify all English voice actors, particularly for minor characters like Dogra and Saint Jalmack.
**Status:** Left some English voice actor fields empty where verification was not possible.

### Animation Quality Details
**Issue:** Without viewing the episode, could not assess sakuga moments or specific animation quality details.
**Status:** Marked as "STANDARD" animation quality based on the episode's position in the series (2011 production).

### External Media Limitations
**Issue:** Many reaction videos are behind paywalls (Patreon) or on platforms with limited metadata.
**Status:** Documented available external media but could not access engagement metrics (views, likes) for most sources.

## Important Questions

1. **Exact Timestamps**: Should timestamps be verified by someone who can watch the episode?
2. **Missing Voice Actors**: Should English voice actors for Dogra, Magra, and Saint Jalmack be researched further?
3. **Manga Differences**: Are there specific anime-original scenes or extended sequences that should be documented in more detail?
4. **Character IDs**: Confirmed character ID format (e.g., "saint-jalmack" vs "jalmack") - used full names with titles for consistency.
