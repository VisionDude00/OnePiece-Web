    "theoryText": "Zoro's Asura form, first seen during his battle with Kaku at Enies Lobby, is one of the earliest indicators that Zoro possesses Conqueror's Haki. The technique manifests through sheer willpower, creating the illusion of additional heads and arms. This was later confirmed when Kaido stated that Zoro was using Conqueror's Haki during their battle in Wano, and that Zoro's Asura technique specifically draws upon this power. Interestingly, even after this revelation, Zoro remains unaware that he is a Conqueror's Haki user, meaning he has been using it unconsciously since Enies Lobby.",

    "theoryText": "According to a theory by Reddit user u/cerbero275, Zoro's Asura form might transform into a Devil Fruit after he dies. This speculation is based on Vegapunk's theory about Devil Fruits being possibilities of human evolution. If willpower and spiritual energy can manifest as physical abilities (as seen with Asura), these abilities might crystallize into Devil Fruits that can be passed on to future generations. This would explain how some of the more unusual Devil Fruits came to exist.",

    "theoryText": "A theory discussed in the Never Watched One Piece blog suggests that Asura might be the manifestation of all three of Zoro's swords' souls working together. This connects to the broader theory that swords in One Piece have souls or spirits, particularly cursed swords like Sandai Kitetsu. The three faces and six additional arms (making nine total weapons) could represent the three swords each contributing their spiritual power. Some versions of this theory suggest Zoro inherited some kind of power from one of his cursed swords that allows this manifestation.",

    "theoryText": "A lighthearted fan theory from the Never Watched One Piece blog suggests that Kaku, despite being an antagonist, shows enough genuine character (including regret about his actions in Water 7) that he deserves redemption. The blogger jokingly proposes that Kaku should become a zoo worker alongside other CP9 members with animal-based powers. This theory reflects fans' sympathy for Kaku as a more likeable antagonist compared to other CP9 members.",

    "theoryText": "Building on the confirmation that Asura uses Conqueror's Haki, fan theorists speculate that if Zoro learns to consciously control and infuse Asura with advanced Conqueror's Haki (coating), it would make him nearly unstoppable. Since Zoro currently uses Asura unconsciously without realizing he has Conqueror's Haki, mastering this ability could represent a massive power-up. This theory suggests that future uses of Asura will be exponentially more powerful as Zoro's understanding of Haki grows.",
