    "theoryText": "Bartholomew Kuma deliberately sent Luffy to Amazon Lily as part of a larger plan to help him survive and grow stronger. By sending Luffy to this location, Kuma ensured: 1) Luffy would be in a relatively safe location away from the Marines and World Government, 2) Luffy would have the opportunity to meet and learn from Rayleigh who could teach him Haki, an essential ability for the New World, and 3) Luffy would form an alliance with Boa Hancock and the Kuja tribe, gaining powerful allies for future conflicts. Kuma, who was secretly allied with the Revolutionary Army, foresaw that these developments would be crucial for Luffy's survival and eventual success.",

    "theoryText": "According to this fan theory, Nefertari D. Lili was the founder of Amazon Lily, and her love for Joy Boy led to the creation of 'love sickness' - a condition that affects Kuja empresses when they fall in love. The theory suggests that Lili's unfulfilled love for Joy Boy became a genetic or cultural curse passed down through the Kuja lineage, explaining why empresses who fall in love often suffer from this mysterious and potentially fatal illness. This would connect Amazon Lily to the greater mysteries of the Void Century and the D. clan.",

    "theoryText": "Luffy landing on Amazon Lily represents a thematic parallel to the series' beginning. Just as Luffy started his journey emerging from a barrel (a confined space) into the world of adventure, he now emerges from a paw-shaped bubble (another confined space) into a completely new and unfamiliar world. This marks a 'rebirth' for Luffy as he transitions from the Paradise half of the Grand Line to eventually entering the New World. The all-female island forces Luffy into a situation where his usual approaches don't work, symbolizing his need to grow and adapt for the challenges ahead.",
