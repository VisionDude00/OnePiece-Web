    "theoryText": "The Davy Back Fight introduced in the Long Ring Long Land arc serves as foreshadowing for a future competition between Luffy's Straw Hat Pirates and Shanks' Red Hair Pirates. Since both crews are friendly and neither Luffy nor Shanks would want to harm each other in actual combat, a Davy Back Fight would allow them to compete honorably without ill-intent. This would enable matchups like Usopp vs Yasopp (his father) in a shooting contest, Sanji vs Lucky Roux in cooking/speed challenges, and ultimately Luffy vs Shanks in the Combat game, mirroring Luffy vs Foxy from Long Ring Long Land.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that the Long Ring Long Land arc, despite being widely disliked, was intentionally placed between Skypeia and Water 7 to serve multiple purposes: providing a lighter tone before the intense Water 7 saga, introducing the Davy Back Fight concept for future use, and demonstrating different types of pirate traditions in the One Piece world. The arc's seemingly 'filler-like' nature may be deliberate misdirection, hiding important foreshadowing that will pay off later in the series.",
