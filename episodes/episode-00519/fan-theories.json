    "theoryTitle": "Straw Hat Time Skip Training Predictions",
    "theoryText": "Before the Return to Sabaody arc aired, fans theorized extensively about what training each Straw Hat underwent during the two-year timeskip. Many correctly predicted Luffy would learn Haki, that Franky would upgrade his cyborg body, and that the crew would return significantly more powerful. Episode 519 begins to confirm these theories as the crew reunites and showcases their new abilities.",

This theory was widely accepted before being confirmed when the crew successfully reunites at Sabaody in episodes 517-519.",

    "theoryText": "When Caribou debuted in Episode 519, fans immediately speculated he would play a significant antagonistic role in the upcoming Fish-Man Island arc. His high bounty, Logia Devil Fruit, and cruel nature suggested he would cause trouble for the Straw Hats or the residents of Fish-Man Island. This theory proved correct as Caribou became a recurring threat throughout the arc.",
