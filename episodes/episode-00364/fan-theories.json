    "theoryTitle": "Shadow Memory Transfer Inconsistency",
    "theoryText": "One of the unresolved mysteries of Thriller Bark is that memories a shadow receives should be reciprocated back to their original hosts once reunited. However, this phenomenon was never observed in any members of the Straw Hat pirates, including Luffy, despite his shadow spending significant time in Oars' body. This suggests either the mechanic doesn't work as described, or there's a time/distance limitation we don't know about.",

    "theoryTitle": "Oars as Joy Boy Connection",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Oars the Continent-Puller may have been Joy Boy or connected to Joy Boy's legacy. The theory points to Oars' age (died around 500 years ago, right after the Void Century), his massive size similar to ancient giants, and his connection to island-pulling which could relate to Wano's creation. However, this theory is disputed as Oars died at 159 years old, meaning he was born roughly 700-800 years ago.",

    "theoryTitle": "Wano Creation by Continent-Puller",
    "theoryText": "A popular theory suggests that Oars or an ancestor created Wano by pulling together different landmasses. The theory notes that Wano is suspiciously divided into distinct regions with different climates, and the rivers splitting Wano into six sections could actually be where different landmasses were fused together. The presence of a gigantic Oars-sized skull on Onigashima supports this theory, suggesting ancient giants had a significant role in Wano's formation.",

Recent series revelations suggest horns are a result of having ancient giant blood, which would connect Kaido, Oars, and potentially other horned characters through a shared ancestry.",

    "theoryText": "The Thriller Bark arc presents a thematic contrast between Moria's philosophy of using shadows/zombies to do all the work versus the Straw Hats' genuine teamwork. The symbolism analysis suggests that people who lost their shadows didn't lose their humanity, just the ability to go in sunlight. Moria believed shadows contained everything that made a person, but the arc proves that true strength comes from living bonds, not controlling dead vessels with fragments of humanity.",

    "theoryText": "Fans debate whether Nightmare Luffy (powered by 100 shadows) was stronger than Gear Fourth Boundman. Arguments suggest Nightmare Luffy's raw power was impressive, but he lacked precision and couldn't permanently defeat Oars because zombies don't feel pain. The time limit (10 minutes) and lack of control make it difficult to directly compare to Gear Fourth's more refined and strategic approach.",
