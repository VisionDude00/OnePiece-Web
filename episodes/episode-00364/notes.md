# Research Notes for Episode 364: "Oars Roars! Come Out, Straw Hat Crew"

## Research Date
November 25, 2025

## Episode Overview
Episode 364 is part of the Thriller Bark arc and focuses on Oars beginning his rampage across Thriller Bark after receiving orders from Moria to hunt down and destroy all Straw Hat Pirates. The episode features several key moments including the debut of Robin's Pierna Fleur technique, the attempted Robi-Cho Suplex combination attack, Cindry's moment of humanity, Hogback's defeat, and the assembly of the Straw Hat crew to face Oars.

## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
- **Primary Sources**: One Piece Wiki (Fandom) for episode data, character information, and technique details
- **Secondary Sources**: CBR articles, Game Rant articles, OP Fan Page analysis
- **Multimedia**: The One Piece Podcast episodes, reaction videos on Bilibili and Patreon
- **Official Platforms**: Crunchyroll listing, IMDb entry

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Limited Script Availability**: Could not locate a complete, line-by-line transcript of the episode. Relied on episode summaries, recaps, and wiki information to construct event timeline.

2. **Timestamp Estimation**: Without access to the full episode video, timestamps were estimated based on typical One Piece episode structure (22-23 minutes runtime) and the sequence of events described in summaries. These timestamps should be considered approximate.

3. **Voice Actor Information**: Could not find complete voice actor credits for all characters. Some minor character voice actors may be missing from the credits section.

4. **External Media Gaps**: Many reaction videos and podcast episodes found were behind paywalls (Patreon) or didn't provide specific episode-by-episode breakdowns. YouTube searches yielded limited results for episode-specific content, likely due to copyright issues.

5. **Opening/Ending Song Confirmation**: Confirmed that "Jungle P" by 5050 was the opening for episode 364 (episodes 326-372). Ending themes had been discontinued since episode 279, so no ending song for this episode.

## Key Findings

### New Techniques Debuted
1. **Pierna Fleur** - Robin's leg-sprouting technique using Hana Hana no Mi
2. **Robi-Cho Suplex** - Combination technique between Robin and Chopper (attempted but interrupted)

### Character Moments
- **Cindry**: Significant character moment where her humanity resurfaces and she refuses to save Hogback, instead smiling at Chopper
- **Hogback**: Defeated/killed when trampled by Oars
- **Oars**: Demonstrates Luffy's combat techniques (Gomu Gomu no Kane) despite lacking rubber body

### Plot Significance
- First full episode where Oars actively hunts the Straw Hats
- Sets up the major crew battle against Oars (episodes 365-367)
- Demonstrates consequences of Moria's zombie creation (Oars causes collateral damage to his own side)

## Fan Theory Highlights

1. **Shadow Memory Transfer Inconsistency**: Noted as a plot hole - Luffy should have received Oars' memories when his shadow returned, but this never happens
2. **Oars-Joy Boy Connection**: Debated theory about Oars' potential connection to Joy Boy or the Void Century
3. **Wano Creation Theory**: Popular theory that Oars or ancestors created Wano by pulling landmasses together
4. **Ancient Giant Bloodline**: Theory connecting Oars, Kaido, and other horned characters through shared ancestry

## Quality Assessment

### Completeness
- **Episode Metadata**: ✅ Complete (title, dates, arc, credits)
- **Events**: ✅ 12 major events documented with timestamps
- **Characters**: ✅ 5 characters with incremental data
- **Locations**: ✅ 2 locations documented
- **Devil Fruits**: ✅ 2 fruits with new abilities/moments
- **Crews**: ✅ 2 crews with key moments
- **External Media**: ✅ 10 items (articles, podcasts, reactions)
- **Fan Theories**: ✅ 6 theories documented
- **Sources**: ✅ 18 sources cited

### Areas of Uncertainty

1. **Exact Timestamps**: All timestamps are estimated based on episode flow, not verified against actual episode playback

2. **Complete Voice Cast**: May be missing some minor character voice actors

3. **Episode 364 vs Episodes 364-365**: Many external media sources cover episodes 364-365 together, making it difficult to separate episode-specific content

4. **Manga Differences**: Limited information available about specific differences between the anime episode and manga chapter 469

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. **Video Access**: Accessing the actual episode would allow for:
   - Precise timestamp verification
   - Screenshot/image capture for events
   - Verification of exact dialogue quotes
   - Identification of additional minor events or character appearances
   - Confirmation of animation quality notes

2. **Translation Verification**: Compare English and Japanese episode summaries to ensure no details were lost in translation

3. **Community Discussion**: Search Reddit's r/OnePiece for episode discussion threads from 2008 (Japan air date) and 2016 (US air date) for fan reactions and observations

4. **Manga Comparison**: Read Chapter 469 directly to document specific anime-original additions or changes

## Open Questions

1. **MocDonald Character**: Listed as appearing in this episode but no significant role documented - needs investigation
2. **Perona's Role**: Listed in voice credits but no specific scene or moment documented in events
3. **Art Direction Credit**: Two art directors listed (Ryūji Yoshiike, Michiyo Kawasaki) - unusual, may indicate special episode or correction needed
4. **Nami's Status**: She's listed as unconscious/captured, but need to verify if she regains consciousness at any point in this episode

## Production Notes

- **Manga Adaptation**: Episode 364 adapts Chapter 469, pages 2-19 (out of approximately 19 pages total)
- **Pacing**: This suggests relatively faithful adaptation with approximately 17 manga pages adapted into one episode
- **Arc Position**: Episode 364 is episode 28 out of 45 episodes in the Thriller Bark arc (337-381)
- **DVD Release**: US DVD release was January 13, 2015, while Toonami broadcast was October 8, 2016

## Conclusion

Episode 364 research completed successfully with comprehensive data across all required categories. Main limitation was lack of direct episode access for timestamp verification and visual documentation. All critical plot points, character moments, and technique debuts documented. Ready for merge with other episode data.
