Bellemère, Nami and Nojiko's adoptive mother, could only afford to pay for her daughters. Rather than deny their existence as her family, she paid for them and sacrificed herself. Arlong killed Bellemère and forced young Nami to become his cartographer. In the present, Nami's eight years of savings to buy back her village are seized by corrupt Marine Captain Nezumi.",
