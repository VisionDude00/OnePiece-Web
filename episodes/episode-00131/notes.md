# Episode 131 Research Notes

## Episode Overview
Episode 131 "The First Patient! The Untold Story of the Rumble Ball!" is the first episode in the Post-Arabasta filler arc, consisting of five character-focused standalone episodes (131-135).

## Research Challenges
- **Limited Script Availability**: No full episode script was found online. Research relied on wiki summaries, blog posts, and episode databases.
- **Web Scraping Issues**: Some analysis articles (manganoa.com, poggers.com) had technical issues with CSS/JavaScript making content extraction difficult.
- **Filler Episode Context**: As an anime-original filler episode, there's no manga source material to cross-reference.

## Key Findings

### Character Development
This episode is significant for Robin's character arc:
- First major one-on-one interaction between Robin and another crew member (Chopper)
- Robin reveals her loneliness dating back to age 8
- The campfire scene at the end symbolically shows Robin's continued isolation despite joining the crew
- **Foreshadowing**: This episode plants seeds for Robin's eventual "I want to live!" moment in the Enies Lobby arc (episodes 269-278)

### Rumble Ball Backstory
