    "title": "Doriki Doesn't Account for Devil Fruits - Major Power System Flaw",
    "theory": "The doriki measurement system introduced in Episode 266 is fundamentally flawed because it only measures base physical power and doesn't account for Devil Fruit abilities. This means characters like Kaku and Kalifa, who ate their Devil Fruits just before the battles, would have much higher effective combat power than their doriki suggests. Some fans theorize that Oda intentionally made the system flawed to show that power can't be reduced to simple numbers.",

    "theory": "Rob Lucci's 4000 doriki measurement in Episode 266 represents his base human form power, not his Zoan form. Fans theorize that in his full Leopard form, his doriki would be significantly higher (estimated 6000-8000). This theory suggests the doriki system was measuring their base forms to provide a fair comparison, and their actual combat effectiveness with Devil Fruits would be much higher.",

    "theory": "Spandam having only 9 doriki (less than a regular Marine soldier's 10) in Episode 266 is a deliberate narrative choice by Oda to emphasize that in the World Government, political power and connections matter more than physical strength. Fans theorize this foreshadows themes about systemic power imbalance in the World Government that become more apparent later in the series.",

Fans theorize this small gap was meant to show they're nearly equal, which adds tension to their interactions and makes their competitive banter more meaningful. The closeness also suggests either could surpass the other with training.",

    "theory": "Fans theorize that if doriki were still being measured in current One Piece arcs, Rob Lucci (now in CP0) would have around 8000-10000 doriki based on his training over the timeskip and subsequent years. This theory uses the base of his 4000 doriki from Episode 266 and assumes he roughly doubled his power through training, similar to how the Straw Hats grew stronger. This would explain why he remains a credible threat in later arcs.",
