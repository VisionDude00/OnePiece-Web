## Episode Content Summary

Episode 266 is a pivotal episode in the Enies Lobby arc that introduces the **doriki measurement system**, one of the most discussed power-scaling elements in One Piece. The episode features two main storylines:

### Main Gate Battle
The Franky Family and Galley-La Company work together in a coordinated assault to defeat the giant guard **Kashii**. Through teamwork and strategic techniques (Sentei Kaitai Giri, Timber Hitch Tug, and Trunnel Lock), they successfully bring down the massive opponent, showcasing the power of unity over individual strength.

### CP9 Power Reveals
In the Tower of Justice, the CP9 agents reunite for the first time in five years. **Fukurou** demonstrates his unique **Te-awase** technique to measure the physical power (doriki) of all CP9 members:

- **Rob Lucci:** 4000 (overwhelmingly strongest)
- **Kaku:** 2200
- **Jabra:** 2180
- **Blueno:** 820
- **Kumadori:** 810
- **Fukurou:** 800
- **Kalifa:** 630
- **Spandam:** 9 (weaker than average soldier)

This power hierarchy establishes Rob Lucci as the primary antagonist for the arc and creates dramatic tension for upcoming battles.

## Notable Findings

### Historical Significance
1. **First and only introduction of doriki system** - Never used again after Enies Lobby arc
2. **Last ending theme for 17 years** - "Adventure World" was the last ending until 2023
3. **Rob Lucci's 4000 doriki** - Highest officially measured power level in series
4. **Animation quality:** Standard (TV rating: 10.2%, ranked 5th in time slot)

### Thematic Elements
1. **Teamwork over individual strength** - Kashii defeated through coordination
2. **Power ≠ Authority** - Spandam's 9 doriki shows political power matters more
3. **Measurement limitations** - Doriki doesn't account for Devil Fruits or weapons

### Character Dynamics
- **Kaku vs Jabra rivalry** - Only 20 doriki apart (2200 vs 2180)
- **Gatherine love triangle** - Rejected Jabra, interested in Lucci
- **Spandam's overconfidence** - Incomplete intelligence about Luffy
