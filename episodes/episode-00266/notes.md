# Research Notes for Episode 266

## Episode Overview
Episode 266 "Battle Against Giants! Open the Second Gate!" is a pivotal episode in the Enies Lobby arc that introduces one of the most important power measurement systems in One Piece - the doriki system.

## Key Research Findings

### Doriki System Introduction
- This episode marks the first and primary introduction of the doriki measurement system
- The system is unique to the Enies Lobby arc and is never used again after this story arc
- Fukurou's Te-awase is the only known method to measure doriki
- Important limitation: Doriki only measures base physical power, NOT Devil Fruit abilities or weapons

### Power Hierarchy Established
The doriki reveals in this episode establish a clear CP9 power hierarchy:
1. Rob Lucci: 4000 (nearly 2x stronger than #2)
2. Kaku: 2200
3. Jabra: 2180 (only 20 below Kaku - sets up rivalry)
4. Blueno: 820
5. Kumadori: 810
6. Fukurou: 800
7. Kalifa: 630
8. Spandam: 9 (weaker than average soldier at 10)

### Character Debuts
- Gatherine debuts but only through mention, never appears on screen
- This is unusual for a character debut - most debuts show the character visually

### Production Notes
- TV Rating: 10.2% (ranked 5th in time slot)
- Animation error: Franky Family boat labeled "Frnky" and "Eranky"
- Last episode to use "Adventure World" ending theme for 17 years

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- Could not find a complete episode script/transcript
- Had to rely on wiki summaries and episode information
- Would benefit from official Crunchyroll/Funimation scripts for exact dialogue

### Timestamp Accuracy
- Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure
- Opening typically ends around 3:00, events distributed throughout ~22 minute episode
- Would be more accurate with actual episode viewing, but based on standard pacing

### External Media Limitations
- Many reaction videos and analyses exist for the Enies Lobby arc as a whole
- Few sources focus specifically on Episode 266 alone
- Most analysis combines multiple episodes or discusses the arc broadly

## Notable Observations

### Thematic Elements
1. **Teamwork vs Individual Strength**: Kashii's defeat shows that coordinated teamwork can overcome individual power
2. **Power ≠ Authority**: Spandam's 9 doriki demonstrates that political power doesn't require physical strength
3. **Measurement Limitations**: The doriki system's flaws foreshadow that power cannot be reduced to simple numbers

### Foreshadowing
- Rob Lucci's overwhelming 4000 doriki sets him up as the arc's final boss
- The close Kaku/Jabra rivalry (20 doriki gap) creates tension for future episodes
- Spandam's incomplete intelligence about Luffy foreshadows his overconfidence being shattered

### Cultural Impact
- The doriki system became a popular topic of fan discussion despite only appearing in one arc
- Fans still reference and speculate about hypothetical doriki measurements for current-era characters
- The system's limitations are frequently analyzed in power-scaling discussions

## Follow-Up Items
