    "theoryText": "Fan theory suggests that Usopp's deep love and care for the Going Merry was the primary catalyst for the ship developing a Klabautermann. While the whole crew loved the ship, Usopp's role as the unofficial shipwright and his constant repairs and maintenance gave the ship the devotion needed to manifest a spirit. This is why Usopp was the first to see the Klabautermann in Water 7 and the first to recognize its voice in episode 310.",
