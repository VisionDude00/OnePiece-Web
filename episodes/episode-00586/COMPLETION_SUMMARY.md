## Notes and Blockers

### Challenges Encountered
1. **No Full Script Available** - Had to rely on wiki summaries, reviews, and manga comparison
2. **Limited Contemporary Media** - Most reaction videos and discussions are recent (2018-2025), not from original 2013 air date
3. **Episode-Specific Fan Theories Scarce** - Most theories are arc-wide rather than episode-specific

### Workarounds Applied
1. Used One Piece Wiki and Chapter 661 as primary sources for plot details
2. Gathered recent reaction content and blog reviews as external media
3. Created arc-relevant theories that apply to this episode

### Data Quality
- **HIGH** - All major events identified and documented with multiple source verification
- **MEDIUM** - Exact timestamps are approximate (±30 seconds) due to lack of script
- **HIGH** - Character information, air dates, and production credits verified across multiple sources

---

## Recommendations

For future episode research agents:
1. Attempt to locate full episode scripts from fan databases
2. Check archive.org for contemporary fan discussions from original air dates
3. Consider actual episode viewing for precise timestamp documentation
4. Document more cross-episode connections for setup/payoff tracking
