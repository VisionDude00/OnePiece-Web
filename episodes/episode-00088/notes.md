### Animation Quality
According to research, this episode featured extended combat sequences not present in the manga, particularly the Chopper vs. Chessmarimo fight with detailed transformation sequences.

## Research Challenges

1. **No Episode Script:** Could not locate a complete dialogue transcript, limiting ability to quote exact dialogue
2. **Timestamp Approximations:** Without the actual episode video, timestamps are estimated based on typical pacing and plot descriptions
3. **Web Search Limitations:** Several web searches failed or returned unavailable errors during research
4. **YouTube Content:** Specific episode reactions/reviews were difficult to locate; most content covers arc-level or character-level analysis rather than individual episodes

## Confidence Levels

**High Confidence:**
- Episode number, title, air dates
- Arc and saga placement
- Main events and plot points
- Opening/ending songs
- Character debuts and abilities
- Production credits

**Medium Confidence:**
- Exact timestamps (estimated based on plot flow)
