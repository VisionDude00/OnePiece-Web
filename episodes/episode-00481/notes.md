### Sources Found

  - One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Episode 481 and Chapter 572 pages
  - Crunchyroll official streaming
  - IMDb episode entry

- **Script Sources:**
  - No complete word-for-word transcript was found in publicly accessible databases
  - Used plot summaries and detailed descriptions from wiki sources as substitute
  - Cross-referenced multiple sources for accuracy

- **Analysis & Reviews:**

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Limited Script Access:**
   - Could not locate a complete episode transcript/script
   - Relied on detailed plot summaries from multiple sources
   - Dialogue quotes extracted from reviews and wiki summaries rather than verbatim scripts

2. **Timestamp Approximations:**
   - Without access to the actual episode video or detailed scripts, timestamps are estimated based on:
     - Typical One Piece episode pacing
     - Scene descriptions from reviews
     - Standard anime episode structure (opening ~2:00, recap ~3:00, main content ~17:00)
   - All timestamps should be verified if access to the actual episode becomes available

3. **Voice Actor Information:**
   - English dub voice actors found for main characters (Luffy, Ace, Whitebeard, Aokiji)
   - Some minor character English VAs not found
   - All Japanese VAs successfully identified

4. **YouTube/Video Content:**
   - Most reaction videos found were behind Patreon paywalls

3. **Emotional Impact:**

   - Reviews consistently praise the emotional weight of Whitebeard's scenes
   - Bittersweet tone - triumph of Ace's rescue mixed with tragedy of Whitebeard's sacrifice

4. **Character Development:**
   - Ace shows emotional maturity by accepting help rather than feeling shame
   - Squard's redemption arc continues with his attempted sacrifice
