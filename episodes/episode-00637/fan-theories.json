    "theoryText": "After Bartolomeo's barrier ability was revealed in Episode 637, fans theorized that his barrier is absolutely indestructible, even against Haki-infused attacks. Evidence includes Maynard's failed attempt to break the barrier with a Haki-imbued axe, suggesting that the Bari Bari no Mi creates a defense that transcends normal Devil Fruit weaknesses. Some fans speculate this makes Bartolomeo nearly invincible defensively, potentially able to withstand attacks from even the strongest characters like admirals or emperors.",

    "theoryText": "Following the revelation of Bartolomeo's barrier powers in Episode 637, fans theorized about what his Devil Fruit awakening might entail. Popular theories include: (1) The ability to create multiple barriers simultaneously instead of just one, (2) The ability to project barriers at a distance or turn others into barrier users, (3) The creation of offensive barrier weapons like barrier spears or swords, (4) Making entire areas or structures into barriers. This theory highlights how defensive Devil Fruits might gain offensive capabilities through awakening.",

The theory proposed that Garp and Chinjao were once friends, but Garp fell in love with and 'stole' Chinjao's sister, who became Luffy's grandmother (Dragon's mother). This would make Chinjao Luffy's great-uncle and explain the deep personal nature of his grudge beyond just the physical defeat. The theory suggested this was why Chinjao wanted to kill Luffy specifically - to hurt Garp's family bloodline.",

Some fans predicted Bellamy would eventually turn against Doflamingo and ally with Luffy, showing character growth from his earlier villain role. His phrase 'This is the New World! There's no room for mercy!' was interpreted as him trying to convince himself he needed to be cruel to survive.",
