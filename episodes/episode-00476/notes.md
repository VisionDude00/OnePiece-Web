## Key Research Findings

### Episode Significance
This episode represents a crucial turning point in the Marineford War where:

3. **Luffy's exhaustion becomes critical** - The episode title accurately reflects Luffy's deteriorating condition.

### Research Challenges

1. **Timestamps** - Exact timestamps were not available in sources, so estimated timestamps based on typical episode pacing and event sequence from the wiki summaries.

2. **Ending Song** - Confirmed that Episode 476 did not have an ending song, as One Piece discontinued ending themes from Episode 278 onwards until Episode 1071 (a 17-year gap).

3. **Fan Theories** - No specific fan theories found for this particular episode. The Marineford arc as a whole generated significant discussion, but episode-specific theories were not readily available in search results.

4. **Exact Dialogue** - Full episode script was not available, so quotes were reconstructed from wiki summaries and general knowledge of the episode's events.

5. **External Media Dates** - Many reaction videos on Bilibili did not have precise publication dates, so estimated dates were used.

### Additional Observations

- This episode falls in the middle of the Marineford War, which is considered one of One Piece's most epic arcs
- The opening song "One day" by The ROOTLESS (episodes 459-492) was noted for its more somber tone compared to previous openings, fitting the serious nature of the arc
- The episode adapts approximately 16 pages of manga content from Chapter 567
- Multiple character confrontations happen simultaneously, showing the scale of the war
- Garp's character development is particularly significant, as he must choose between family (Luffy and Ace) and duty (Marines)
