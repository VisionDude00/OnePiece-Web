## Research Challenges & Blockers

### Script Availability
- **Issue**: Could not locate a complete episode script/transcript
- **Workaround**: Used multiple sources including wiki summaries, manga chapters (678-679), reviews, and fan recaps to piece together episode events
- **Impact**: Timestamps are approximate rather than precise; some dialogue may not be exact quotes

### External Media Limitations
- **YouTube**: Search did not return specific reaction videos or analysis videos for episode 604
- **Reddit**: No specific discussion threads found for this episode or chapters 678-679
- **Mitigation**: Found alternative sources including podcasts, Tumblr recaps, TikTok content, and professional reviews

### Opening Song Complexity
- **Finding**: Episode has two different openings depending on version
  - Japanese broadcast: "Hands Up!" by Kota Shinzato
