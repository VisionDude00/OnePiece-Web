    "theory": "Shiki the Golden Lion may be the 'lurking legend' that Eiichiro Oda mentioned would appear in the story. Given that Shiki is canon and escaped Impel Down 20+ years ago, he could still be alive and planning something significant. Some fans theorize he may have connections to Blackbeard (Teach) or could appear in the final saga.",

    "theory": "While Strong World is non-canon, Shiki himself is a canon character who appeared in Chapter 0. The theory suggests that because Oda went out of his way to make Shiki canon (even creating Chapter 0 for the movie), he must have future plans for the character. However, with One Piece in its Final Saga and Shiki not appearing yet, many fans debate whether he'll ever return to the main story or remain a movie-exclusive antagonist.",

The ability to levitate massive objects and create flying islands could play a role in the final war or in reaching locations like Laugh Tale.
