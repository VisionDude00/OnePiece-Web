    "summary": "A theory that Joy Boy's apology on the Poneglyph hints that he may be indirectly responsible for the brutal slavery and discrimination that fish-men have endured since the Void Century.",
    "fullText": "This theory proposes that in order to fight the twenty nations that would become the World Government, Joy Boy formed an alliance with various races including Fish-Men, Buccaneers, Giants, and others during the Void Century. Their connection with Joy Boy might be the reason why these races have been tortured and enslaved to such an extent. Joy Boy's failure to fulfill his promise (possibly losing the war against the World Government) left these allied races vulnerable to persecution. This would make Joy Boy indirectly responsible for the struggles and subjugation that Fish-Men have faced for 800+ years, explaining why he left such a heartfelt apology on the Poneglyph specifically for the Mermaid Princess (Poseidon) and Fish-Man Island.",

    "summary": "The theory that Joy Boy promised to use the massive ship Noah to bring fish-men and merfolk to live on the surface under the real sun, but failed to fulfill this promise during the Void Century.",
    "fullText": "During the Void Century, Joy Boy made a deal with the ancient Mermaid Princess (Poseidon) involving the colossal ship Noah. The promise was to raise Noah to the surface and allow fish-men and merfolk to live under the real sun alongside other races. However, Joy Boy failed to keep this promise for unknown reasons (possibly due to losing the war against the World Government or his death). This broken promise is what prompted the apology letter on the Poneglyph. The theory suggests that someone in the future (likely Luffy as the new Joy Boy) will fulfill this ancient promise, finally bringing fish-men to live peacefully on the surface. This connects to Luffy's promise to Shirahoshi and the recurring theme of inherited will.",

    "summary": "A widely accepted interpretation that Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime were intentionally designed as parallels to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., representing different approaches to achieving racial equality.",
    "fullText": "This theory/interpretation posits that Eiichiro Oda deliberately modeled Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime after the real-world civil rights leaders Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Queen Otohime represents the peaceful, diplomatic approach (like MLK), advocating for coexistence, understanding, and legal equality between fish-men and humans. Fisher Tiger represents the more militant, separatist approach (like Malcolm X), believing that fish-men should distance themselves from humans due to the trauma of slavery and discrimination. Both characters fought until their deaths believing that fish-men deserve freedom and respect. Their tragic deaths mirror the assassinations of their real-world counterparts, and like MLK and Malcolm X, they inspired future generations despite their different methods. This parallel adds depth to the Fish-Man Island arc's exploration of racism, discrimination, and the cycle of hatred.",

    "summary": "The theory that Arlong deliberately designed Arlong Park to mirror Sabaody Park as a symbolic reversal of fish-men slavery, with Arlong taking the role of the oppressor and humans as the enslaved.",
    "fullText": "This theory, partially confirmed by Nami's observation in episode 539, suggests that Arlong's design of Arlong Park to mirror Sabaody Park (where fish-men were sold as slaves) was a deliberate psychological reversal. Arlong, having experienced or witnessed the horrors of fish-men being enslaved and auctioned at Sabaody, recreated that environment with humans (specifically Nami and her village) as the enslaved. This represents the cycle of hatred theme central to the Fish-Man Island arc: victims becoming victimizers, perpetuating the same cruelty they experienced. The theory emphasizes that Arlong's cruelty wasn't random but a trauma response, though this doesn't excuse his actions. It shows how discrimination and slavery create generational trauma that perpetuates violence. This connects to Fisher Tiger's inability to fully embrace Otohime's message of peace due to his own trauma as a slave.",
