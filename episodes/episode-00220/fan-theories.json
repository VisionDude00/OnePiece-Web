    "summary": "Some fans theorize that the Ocean's Dream Arc, particularly Noko's desire to become a Sennenryu (Millennium Dragon), is a deliberate callback to the earlier filler Warship Island arc featuring the Millennium Dragons.",
    "fullText": "Fans have noted that Noko's motivation to transform into a Sennenryu (Millennium Dragon) creates a thematic connection to the Warship Island arc (episodes 54-61), which also featured Millennium Dragons. The theory suggests that the anime creators intentionally linked these two filler arcs to create continuity within the filler episodes, even though neither exists in the manga. This would make Noko's impossible dream of transformation more meaningful to viewers who watched the earlier arc, as it references a rare and powerful creature they've already encountered. However, the connection remains superficial, as the arcs don't directly interact beyond this thematic element.",

    "title": "Memory Loss as Character Development Showcase",
    "summary": "The memory loss premise in the Ocean's Dream Arc serves as a narrative device to showcase character development by reverting characters to their pre-crew personalities and highlighting how much they've grown.",
    "fullText": "While not a traditional theory, many One Piece analysts and reviewers have noted that the Ocean's Dream Arc's memory loss plot functions as a clever way to demonstrate character development. By having characters revert to who they were before joining the Straw Hats - Nami becoming a distrustful cat burglar, Zoro returning to his lone bounty hunter ways, Usopp thinking about his children's gang - the arc creates a stark contrast with their current personalities. This allows viewers to see tangibly how much the crew has grown and changed through their shared experiences. FandomWire praised this aspect, noting the arc 'shows how much they've developed since' joining the crew, making it 'pure entertainment and nostalgia' despite being filler. The theory suggests this was the primary creative purpose of the arc: to celebrate the characters' journeys rather than to advance the plot.",

    "title": "Robin's Central Role Reflects Her Recent Joining",
    "summary": "The choice to make Robin the only crew member with intact memories is a deliberate narrative decision that highlights her recent addition to the crew and tests her commitment to the Straw Hats.",
    "fullText": "A common observation among One Piece fans is that Robin's unique position in episode 220 - being the only crew member who retains her memories - is narratively significant. Having joined the crew most recently (episode 130), Robin is ironically the one tasked with keeping everyone together and convincing them of their bonds. However, she struggles precisely because she joined last and lacks deep knowledge of everyone's past adventures. This creates a compelling scenario that tests Robin's commitment to the Straw Hats and demonstrates her growth from a solitary individual to a devoted nakama. The theory suggests this was intentional character exploration by the writers, using the filler arc to develop Robin's relationship with the crew. Her desperate attempts to hold everyone together, despite the difficulty, showcase how much she values her new family - a stark contrast to her previous life on the run.",
