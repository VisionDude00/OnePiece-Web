    "summary": "A theory that emerged from Robin's warning in episode 594 that pirate alliances often end in betrayal, suggesting Law might betray Luffy at some point.",
    "fullText": "When Robin warned in episode 594 that 'alliances come with betrayal,' fans began speculating whether Trafalgar Law would eventually betray the Straw Hats. Some theories suggested Law might betray Luffy to the World Government after Kaido is beaten, since the alliance would technically be over. Others proposed more elaborate scenarios, such as CP0 offering a deal involving Law's sister Lammy. Doflamingo's later statement 'Who will face each other and who will betray each other' in chapter 801 further fueled these theories. However, many fans counter-argue that Law's character development and his statement that if Luffy was defeated, he would go down with him, make betrayal unlikely.",

    "summary": "A theory that Law's real goal in forming the alliance goes beyond defeating Kaido - he actually wants to find the One Piece.",
    "fullText": "Fan analysis suggests that Doflamingo was just a route to Law's greater goal - that being Kaido and ultimately the One Piece. This theory draws parallels to other characters who targeted Emperors as stepping stones: Moriah went after Kaido and Crocodile went after Whitebeard in their respective aims to become Pirate King. Law going after a Yonko would be consistent with actions needed to find One Piece. The theory suggests Law's alliance with Luffy was strategic positioning in the race for the ultimate treasure, rather than purely revenge or ambition.",

    "fullText": "When Law tells Luffy in episode 594 that their plan has only a 30% chance of success, some fans theorized this was Law's pessimistic assessment rather than a realistic calculation. The theory suggests Law, being a strategic thinker and cautious planner, deliberately understated their chances to prepare Luffy for the worst-case scenario. Law's character is known for careful planning and contingency strategies, so a low success estimate would align with his personality. The theory gained traction as the alliance proved more successful than initially stated, suggesting Law either underestimated their combined strength or was testing Luffy's commitment despite seemingly impossible odds.",
