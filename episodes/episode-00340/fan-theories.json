    "theory": "When Hogback reacted suspiciously to the mention of Brook in episode 340, fans immediately theorized that Hogback and the Thriller Bark crew were connected to Brook's missing shadow. The theory proposed that Gecko Moria had stolen Brook's shadow to create a powerful zombie, and Hogback's knowledge of Brook suggested he was involved in this process.",

    "theory": "After seeing the intelligent, speaking zombies in episode 340, fans theorized that these weren't traditional zombies but rather corpses animated by stolen shadows from living people. This theory explained why the zombies could talk, think, and had distinct personalities - they retained the memories and traits of the people whose shadows were stolen.",
