## Research Highlights

### What Went Well
1. **Comprehensive Wiki Research:** One Piece Wiki provided excellent detail on all characters, locations, and events
2. **Multiple Perspectives:** Found both analytical recaps and first-time viewer reactions
3. **Complete Metadata:** All production credits, air dates, and technical details verified
4. **Rich Event Documentation:** 13 detailed events capture the episode's narrative flow
5. **Quality External Media:** Found diverse sources (articles, podcasts, video reactions)

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Script Availability ⚠️
- **Challenge:** Could not locate complete episode transcript
- **Impact:** Exact dialogue and timing unavailable
- **Solution:** Used detailed plot summaries and multiple recap sources
- **Status:** Mitigated but not ideal

#### 2. Timestamp Accuracy ⚠️
- **Challenge:** No source provided exact event timestamps
- **Impact:** All 13 timestamps are estimates
- **Solution:** Based on typical One Piece pacing and plot progression
- **Status:** Reasonable estimates but should be verified

#### 3. YouTube Analysis Scarcity
- **Challenge:** Limited episode-specific YouTube analytical content
- **Impact:** Fewer video analysis sources
- **Solution:** Found reaction videos and podcasts instead
- **Status:** Adequate coverage achieved

#### 4. Minor Character VAs
- **Challenge:** Voice actors for MocDonald, Unigaro, Buhichuck not found
- **Impact:** Some character records incomplete
- **Solution:** Left voice actor fields empty
- **Status:** Acceptable for minor characters

## Questions for Human Review

### High Priority
1. **Timestamp Verification:** Should all 13 event timestamps be flagged for future verification when episode is watched directly?

2. **Script Access:** Is there a preferred or official source for One Piece episode scripts we should use for future research?

### Medium Priority
3. **Event Granularity:** Are 13 events the appropriate level of detail, or should we aim for more/fewer events per episode?

4. **Manga Comparison:** Should manga differences be verified by directly reading Chapters 445-446?

5. **Voice Actor Research:** Should we attempt to find Japanese VAs for all characters including minor zombies?

### Low Priority
6. **YouTube Channels:** Are there specific One Piece YouTube channels we should prioritize for analysis videos?

7. **Reddit Archives:** Should we search historical Reddit threads for real-time fan reactions?
