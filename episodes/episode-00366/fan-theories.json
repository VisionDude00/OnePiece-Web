    "title": "Lola's Mother is Big Mom (Charlotte Linlin)",
    "summary": "A popular fan theory that emerged during the Thriller Bark arc, suggesting that Lola's mother - described as a powerful pirate in the New World - was actually Charlotte Linlin (Big Mom), one of the Four Emperors.",
    "fullText": "During Thriller Bark, Lola gave Nami a vivre card pointing to her mother, who she described as a powerful pirate in the New World. Fans theorized that this mother was Big Mom because: 1) Big Mom's epithet literally means 'Big Mom', 2) She was known to have many children, 3) Lola's vivre card was described as leading to someone very powerful in the New World, which matched Big Mom's status as a Yonko. This theory was later confirmed in the Whole Cake Island arc, revealing that Charlotte Lola is indeed the 23rd daughter of Charlotte Linlin and that she ran away from an arranged marriage to Prince Loki of Elbaph, which caused Big Mom to lose her chance at peace with the giants.",

    "summary": "A theory about the nature of Perona's loyalty to Gecko Moria, suggesting it went deeper than mere convenience or employment.",
    "fullText": "While Perona often stated she was only following Gecko Moria out of convenience, many fans theorized that her feelings were actually far more meaningful. This was later confirmed when it was revealed that Perona sees Moria as a father figure, since he found her when she was still a child and raised her. This explains why she strongly believes he is still alive even after his disappearance following the Paramount War, and why her decision to abandon Thriller Bark in Episode 366 was such a significant character moment - it showed her prioritizing self-preservation over loyalty, which was unusual for her deeper emotional connection to Moria.",

    "summary": "Fan observations about Absalom's predatory behavior extending beyond his obsession with Nami.",
    "fullText": "Fans noted that Absalom's behavior in the Thriller Bark arc, particularly his forced marriage attempt with Nami, represented a darker theme in One Piece regarding consent and bodily autonomy. Some fans speculated that Absalom likely harassed other characters as well, given his pattern of using his Clear-Clear Fruit powers for voyeuristic purposes. This character analysis led to discussions about how Nami's victory over Absalom in Episode 366 represented not just a physical victory, but a thematic statement about female empowerment and fighting back against predatory behavior. The scene where Lola helps Nami and Nami fights back was seen as particularly significant in this context.",
