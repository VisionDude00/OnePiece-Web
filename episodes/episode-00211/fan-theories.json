    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that the Davy Back Fight introduced in the Long Ring Long Land arc will play a significant role later in the series. Some believe that Luffy and Shanks might have a Davy Back Fight instead of a traditional battle, or that the Rocks Pirates used Davy Back Fights to recruit their powerful crew members. Recent manga chapters have supported this theory by revealing that Rocks D. Xebec worshipped Davy Jones and used Davy Back Fights to gather the Rocks Pirates.",
