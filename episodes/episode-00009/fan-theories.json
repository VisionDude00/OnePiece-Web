    "title": "Klahadore's Split Personality Theory",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Kuro may have developed a split personality rather than simply being skilled at acting two different roles. The evidence for this includes the distinct voice changes between his 'Klahadore' persona (lighter, formal tone) and his 'Kuro' persona (deeper, colder voice) in the anime. This suggests that after three years of maintaining his butler disguise, the Klahadore identity may have become more than just an act, creating a psychological split between his two personas.",

    "title": "Did Kuro Kill Kaya's Parents?",
    "theoryText": "A persistent fan theory questions whether Captain Kuro was responsible for the death of Kaya's parents. While Kuro denies this to his former first mate in the story, some fans remain suspicious given his three-year plan to steal Kaya's fortune. The timing of the parents' death and Kuro's arrival as 'Klahadore' seems too convenient. However, Kuro's plan specifically involved hypnosis and a staged pirate attack, suggesting he preferred to appear innocent while orchestrating events from the shadows rather than direct murder.",

    "title": "Kuro's Glasses Adjustment - Hidden Weapon Foreshadowing",
    "theoryText": "Observant fans noted from Episode 9 that Klahadore has an unusual habit of adjusting his glasses with his palm instead of his fingers. This seemingly innocuous quirk was theorized to be foreshadowing for a hidden weapon or fighting style. The theory was later confirmed when Kuro's true identity was revealed along with his signature cat claw weapons - he developed the palm-adjustment habit to avoid scarring his face while wearing the claws, meaning he never stopped training during his three-year undercover mission.",
