    "theoryText": "Roronoa Zoro is theorized to be a direct descendant of the legendary samurai Shimotsuki Ryuma through the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country. This connection is supported by several pieces of evidence: their similar appearance, Zoro's natural affinity for swordsmanship, his ability to master techniques like Hiryu: Kaen (which mirrors Ryuma's dragon-slaying), and the fact that Zoro was deemed worthy to inherit Shusui. The theory suggests that Zoro's lineage explains his exceptional talent and his deep connection to Wano-style swordsmanship.",

    "theoryText": "A popular fan theory suggests that the island serving as the base for Thriller Bark is actually a fragment of the destroyed God Valley. The theory is supported by several connections: both locations are associated with the West Blue, and Captain John (a high-ranking member of the Rocks Pirates who was present at the God Valley Incident) appears as a zombie on Thriller Bark. The theory proposes that after the legendary God Valley Incident, this chunk was all that remained of the island, which Gecko Moria later found and incorporated into his floating fortress.",

    "theoryText": "The debut of Hiryu: Kaen in Episode 362 was theorized to foreshadow Zoro's eventual confrontation with Kaido. The technique features a dragon motif and fire, both strongly associated with Kaido. Since Ryuma was famous for slaying a dragon, and Zoro defeats Ryuma using a dragon-themed technique, fans theorized this was Oda foreshadowing Zoro's role in fighting Kaido, the 'Strongest Creature' who takes the form of an Eastern dragon. This theory was partially confirmed when Zoro later used Hiryu: Kaen against Kaido in Episode 1017.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Oda always intended for Zoro to temporarily possess Shusui before returning it to Wano, as a narrative device to strengthen Zoro's connection to Wano Country and the Shimotsuki clan. The theory suggests that Shusui served as a 'placeholder' sword, teaching Zoro to wield a black blade while foreshadowing his eventual journey to Wano. By having Zoro return the national treasure, it demonstrates his growth not just as a swordsman but as a person who respects cultural significance over personal power, while receiving Enma (another legendary blade with ties to his potential heritage) in exchange.",
