## Challenges & Blockers

### 1. Limited Script Access
**Issue:** Could not find a complete, detailed line-by-line transcript for Episode 311.
**Resolution:** Used wiki summaries, manga chapter information (Chapter 429), and multiple secondary sources to piece together the episode's events.
**Impact:** Timestamps are approximate rather than exact. May be off by 5-30 seconds.

### 2. Web Search Unavailability
**Issue:** Web search functionality became unavailable partway through research.
**Resolution:** Used information already gathered and created external media entries based on sources found earlier in the session.
**Impact:** External media list may be less comprehensive than ideal. Could benefit from additional YouTube analysis videos and podcast episodes.

### 3. Exact Timestamps
**Issue:** Without watching the episode directly or having access to a timestamped script, exact timestamps are estimates.
**Resolution:** Used typical episode structure (intro ~1-2 min, events spread across ~21 minutes, credits ~23 min) to create reasonable estimates.
**Impact:** Timestamps should be verified if precise timing is critical.

### 4. Voice Actor Credits
**Issue:** Could not verify complete list of voice actors for all characters appearing in this episode.
**Resolution:** Included main character voice actors that are well-documented and consistent across the series.
**Impact:** Minor characters may be missing voice actor credits.

### 5. External Media Engagement Metrics
**Issue:** Could not access view counts, like counts, or other engagement metrics for most external media.
**Resolution:** Left these fields as null in the JSON.
**Impact:** External media entries lack popularity indicators.

## Questions for Review

### Minor Uncertainties

1. **Exact Timestamps:** All timestamps are estimates. Should be verified against actual episode if precision is required.

2. **Animation Director Credit:** Listed as "Naoki Tate" but could not verify if there were additional key animators for specific sequences.

3. **Complete Character List:** Focused on main characters with significant moments. Minor characters (individual Marines, background Galley-La workers) may not be fully documented.

4. **Ending Song:** Confirmed that episodes after 279 don't have ending themes, but couldn't verify if there were any special exceptions.

5. **Episode Relationships:** Setup/payoff episode numbers are based on general arc knowledge. May benefit from verification against other episode research.

### Suggested Follow-ups

1. **Video Analysis:** If possible, watch the episode directly to verify timestamps and catch any subtle details missed in text summaries.

2. **Extended External Media Search:** When web search is available, search for:
   - YouTube analysis videos (GrandLineReview, Tekking101, etc.)
   - Podcast episodes discussing this arc
   - Reddit discussion threads from when episode aired
   - Reaction compilation videos

3. **Cross-Reference:** Once other episodes in the Enies Lobby arc are researched, cross-reference events, relationships, and payoffs.

4. **Voice Actor Verification:** Verify complete voice actor list for all speaking characters in this episode.

## Recommendations

### For Future Episodes

1. **Attempt to locate episode scripts early** - Makes event identification and timestamp accuracy much easier.

2. **Cross-reference multiple wikis** - Japanese wiki, English wiki, and other language versions sometimes have different details.

3. **Search for fan content immediately** - YouTube analysis, reactions, and discussions provide valuable community perspective.

4. **Note animation quality moments** - Sakuga (exceptional animation), budget constraints, or special visual techniques.

### For This Episode Specifically

1. **Episode 312 Connection:** Episode 311 sets up the Going Merry farewell in Episode 312. When researching 312, ensure strong connections are made to events in 311.

2. **Bounty Updates:** After Enies Lobby, the crew receives new bounties. This may be referenced in later episodes (320-321 range).

3. **Aokiji's Character:** His appearance and declaration here connect to his earlier introduction (225-228) and later developments. Track his character arc.
