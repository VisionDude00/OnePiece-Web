    "summary": "A theory that Sanji wanted the Clear-Clear Fruit not for perverted reasons as a child, but to escape his abusive Vinsmoke family.",
    "fullText": "This theory suggests that as a kid, Sanji didn't want the Suke Suke no Mi for perverted reasons. Instead, he wanted to disappear to get away from his family, and the fruit would have given him a way to do so. The theory connects to the Vinsmoke family's nature as assassins, noting that the ability to disappear is the greatest skill an assassin could own. The deeper interpretation is that Sanji probably wasn't interested in 'peeping on women' when he was really little, but rather wanted to be invisible because he was being beaten by his family physically and emotionally. This adds a tragic layer to what appears to be a comedic character moment in Episode 359.",

    "summary": "The setup in Episode 359 foreshadows why Usopp will be the only Straw Hat who can defeat Perona - his naturally negative mindset makes him immune to her Negative Ghosts.",
    "fullText": "Episode 359 sets up the confrontation between Usopp and Perona, which becomes one of the most clever matchups in One Piece. Perona's Hollow-Hollow Devil Fruit ability creates 'negative ghosts' that make anyone they pass through become completely demoralized and negative about themselves. However, because Usopp is already so negative and self-deprecating, the ghosts have little to no effect on him. His insecurities had grown so pronounced and so deeply ingrained that Perona's powers could not further undermine him—he had already embraced the worst of his self-image. This ironic twist shows Oda's genius in character matchups, turning Usopp's perceived weakness (his cowardice and negativity) into his greatest strength against this particular opponent.",

    "fullText": "There's a theory that the Suke Suke no Mi, which Sanji reveals he desired in Episode 359, is actually a special Devil Fruit with unique awakening potential. After Absalom's death, the fruit was obtained by Shiryu of the Blackbeard Pirates. The theory suggests that when awakened, the fruit could turn the user into 'nothingness' itself - not just invisible, but actually becoming nothing. This idea originated from Koshiro's flashback during the Mr. 1 fight where the 'ability to cut NOTHING' was mentioned three times. Interestingly, the Ace Novel (Volume 2, Chapter 5) reveals that Blackbeard wanted to eat the Suke Suke no Mi before he got the Yami Yami no Mi, suggesting the fruit may be far more special than its simple invisibility power suggests.",

    "fullText": "In Episode 359, Usopp pursues Perona through Thriller Bark, setting up their eventual confrontation. Fans have theorized about the symbolic significance of Usopp not wearing his Sogeking mask during this arc. The mask lying on the ground during his battle with Perona (in the next episodes) represents Usopp winning as himself, not his alter ego. This symbolizes his character growth - he's beginning to accept his own weaknesses and strengths without needing to hide behind a persona. The irony is that his victory comes precisely because he embraces his negative self-image rather than trying to be a brave warrior like Sogeking. This represents a crucial step in Usopp's journey toward becoming a true brave warrior of the sea.",
