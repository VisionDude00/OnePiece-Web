    "theory": "Zoro's ability to sense the 'breath of all things' in Episode 119 is an early, unconscious manifestation of Observation Haki (Kenbunshoku Haki). When he hears the breath of the rocks and knows where they will fall, and senses where to cut Mr. 1's steel body, he is using a precursor to the Haki system that is formally introduced hundreds of episodes later. This suggests that some characters were using basic forms of Haki even before the timeskip, but didn't understand what it was.",

    "theory": "Koushirou's lesson about being able to cut anything you want to cut, but also not cut what you don't want to cut (like paper), foreshadows the advanced application of Armament Haki seen later in Wano. When Hyogoro teaches Luffy about Ryuo (flowing Haki), the philosophy is similar - it's about control and intent, not just raw power. This suggests that Koushirou may have known about or even possessed Haki himself.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Zoro's ability to sense the breath of all things in Episode 119 foreshadows his later training with Mihawk during the timeskip. The theory suggests that Mihawk may have intentionally injured Zoro's left eye as part of training him to rely more on Observation Haki and this sixth sense rather than just his eyesight. This would be a callback to the lesson learned in Episode 119 about sensing rather than seeing.",

    "theory": "After his defeat by Zoro, Mr. 1 (Daz Bonez) remains loyal to Crocodile and later joins him in Impel Down and the Cross Guild. His honorable acceptance of defeat in Episode 119 establishes his character trait of respecting strength and loyalty, which explains why he continues to serve Crocodile even after Baroque Works is dissolved. The mutual respect shown between Zoro and Mr. 1 also suggests that if they meet again, it would be as honorable rivals rather than enemies.",
