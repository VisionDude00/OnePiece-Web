    "fullText": "Since his introduction in Jaya, hints were given that Blackbeard's body is not normal, finally being confirmed by Marco at the end of Marineford. This theory suggests Blackbeard ate a Tako Tako No Mi (Octopus fruit) before joining the Whitebeard Crew. The theory points to his Jolly Roger featuring 3 skulls and 8 bones (representing octopus tentacles), and that octopuses have 3 hearts and 8 limbs. This would explain how he can hold multiple Devil Fruits - one Devil Fruit for each of his hearts. Episode 484's arrival of Blackbeard at Marineford sets up his ability to steal Whitebeard's Devil Fruit power.",

    "fullText": "Evidence includes how Luffy and Zoro mention during the Jaya arc that Blackbeard is possibly 'more than one' guy, and during the Marineford arc (episode 484-485), Marco mentions that Blackbeard's body is unique. The theory suggests Blackbeard is a genetic chimera - a single organism composed of cells from multiple distinct genetic sources. This would explain his ability to hold multiple Devil Fruits, his lack of sleep, and the plural references to him. The arrival at Marineford in episode 484 sets up the demonstration of this unique body when he steals Whitebeard's power.",

    "fullText": "This Reddit theory suggests that when Blackbeard is under a curtain with no light, he can entirely transform into darkness and draw Whitebeard's Devil Fruit power into himself. The Yami Yami no Mi (Darkness-Darkness Fruit) allows Blackbeard to become darkness itself, and by covering Whitebeard's body with a dark cloth, he can merge with the darkness and extract the Gura Gura no Mi power. Episode 484's setup with Blackbeard arriving 'just in time to see Whitebeard die' foreshadows this moment where he will use the curtain to steal the power.",

    "fullText": "Many fan theories have emerged suggesting that Whitebeard might be a Buccaneer, especially after revelations about the Buccaneer race and Kuma's backstory in later arcs. Episode 484 demonstrates Whitebeard's incredible endurance as he continues fighting despite having part of his face burned off and his torso pierced. The Buccaneer race is known for exceptional physical capabilities and endurance, which could explain Whitebeard's ability to withstand mortal wounds and keep fighting. This theory gained traction after more information about Buccaneers was revealed in the series.",
