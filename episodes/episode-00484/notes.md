# Research Notes for Episode 484

## Episode Title
"The Navy Headquarters Falls! Whitebeard's Unspeakable Wrath!" / "Marine Headquarters Collapses! Whitebeard's Silent Rage!"
- Japanese: "Kaigun Honbu Houkai! Shirohige Kotobanaki Ikari!"

## Research Process

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Timestamp Estimation**: Exact timestamps were not available from all sources, so timestamps were estimated based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions.

2. **Devil Fruit Information**: The four Level 6 prisoners who debut in this episode (Sanjuan Wolf, Catarina Devon, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shot) have Devil Fruits that are revealed much later in the series. For this episode, only their identities and affiliations were documented, not their Devil Fruit abilities.

3. **Censorship Differences**: The anime version of this episode toned down the graphic violence from the manga. In the manga, Akainu's attack completely destroys a portion of Whitebeard's head, but in the anime, this was changed to burning off half of Whitebeard's mustache and piercing his torso in separate attacks.

4. **View Counts**: Many reaction videos were found on Bilibili and other platforms, but specific view counts were not always available or accurate.

### Key Observations

1. **Episode Rating**: This episode has a 9.7/10 rating on IMDb, indicating its high quality and emotional impact.

2. **TV Rating**: The episode achieved an 11.4% TV rating in Japan, ranking 3rd in its time slot.

3. **Ending Theme**: No ending theme was used for this episode, as One Piece discontinued ending themes after episode 279 to allow for longer openings.

4. **Opening Theme**: "One day" by The Rootless is noted as being more somber than previous One Piece openings, reflecting the tragic events of the Marineford Arc.

5. **Multiple Character Debuts**: This episode introduces four major characters (Sanjuan Wolf, Catarina Devon, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shot) simultaneously, which is unusual for One Piece.

### Animation Quality

This episode features extended fight sequences and is considered to have SAKUGA-level animation quality, particularly in the Whitebeard vs. Akainu battle.

### Emotional Impact

Multiple sources note this as one of the most emotionally devastating episodes in the series, showing Luffy's complete mental breakdown and Whitebeard's silent rage over Ace's death.

### Future Implications

This episode sets up:
- Whitebeard's final moments (episode 485)
- Blackbeard's acquisition of the Gura Gura no Mi (episode 485)
- The expansion of the Blackbeard Pirates into the Ten Titanic Captains structure
- Luffy's need for the timeskip training

## Quality Notes

All information has been cross-referenced with multiple sources where possible. The One Piece Wiki was the primary source for factual information, supplemented by official sources (Crunchyroll, IMDb) and fan analyses.

## Recommendations for Future Research

When later episodes reveal the Devil Fruit abilities of Sanjuan Wolf, Catarina Devon, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shot, those episodes should reference back to episode 484 as the debut episode for these characters.
