    "theoryText": "During the Water 7 arc, many first-time viewers theorized about Robin's true motivations for leaving the crew. The theory suggested that Robin wasn't truly betraying the Straw Hats but was instead sacrificing herself to protect them from the World Government's Buster Call. This theory was popular among viewers watching Episode 253 who had seen Robin board the Sea Train but hadn't yet learned her full reasoning.",

    "theoryText": "As Episode 253 showed CP6 agent Jerry aboard the train with CP9 members visible in the background, viewers theorized about the true nature and ranking of Cipher Pol organizations. Many fans speculated that CP9 members (Lucci, Kalifa, Blueno, Kaku) were far more powerful than they had shown while undercover at Galley-La Company, and that their presence on the train indicated Robin's importance to the World Government went beyond simple bounty collection.",

    "theoryText": "Viewers noted that Paulie's statement 'Aqua Laguna is different this year' in Episode 253 was unusual emphasis on the storm's severity. Some fans theorized this wasn't just environmental storytelling but foreshadowing that the abnormally powerful Aqua Laguna would play a crucial role in preventing the Straw Hats from pursuing Robin immediately, creating a natural barrier that separated the crew at a critical moment. The theory suggested this was intentional narrative design to force Sanji to act alone and demonstrate individual character agency.",
