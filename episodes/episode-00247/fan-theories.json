    "theoryText": "While the entire crew cared for the Going Merry, it was specifically Usopp's intense love, dedication, and care for the ship that manifested the Klabautermann. As the ship's unofficial caretaker who performed most of the repairs and maintenance, Usopp's emotional connection was uniquely strong enough to bring the ship's spirit to life.",

The theory suggests that the Klabautermann was created to protect ships from imminent danger, possibly related to the great flood or other ancient catastrophes.

    "theoryText": "A radical theory suggests that Imu, the mysterious ruler of the World Government, might actually be a Klabautermann - specifically, the ship spirit of the Ancient Kingdom itself, if it was a massive city-ship hybrid. This would explain Imu's longevity, mysterious nature, and deep connection to the world's history. The theory connects the emotional ship spirit concept introduced in Water 7 to the series' endgame mysteries.",

Some speculate this could play a crucial role in the final saga, potentially even allowing communication between the Sunny's spirit and the memory of the Merry's Klabautermann.",

    "theoryText": "According to maritime folklore and Franky's explanation, the Klabautermann making itself visible is actually a bad omen - it only reveals itself to the crew when the ship is doomed and cannot be saved. This theory suggests that Usopp seeing the Klabautermann in Skypiea was the ship's way of saying goodbye and preparing the crew (especially Usopp) for its inevitable end, even as it tried to carry them a little while longer.",
