### Challenges and Limitations

1. **No Episode Script Available**: Could not locate a complete episode transcript/script for detailed line-by-line annotation. Relied on wiki summaries and episode guides.

2. **Limited Timestamp Accuracy**: Timestamps are estimated based on general episode structure and event descriptions from sources. Exact timestamps would require watching the episode.

3. **Voice Actor Information**: Complete voice actor credits for all characters were not available. Main character VAs are documented but some minor characters lack this information.

4. **External Media**: Limited YouTube reaction/analysis videos found through web search. More content likely exists but wasn't accessible via search.

5. **Fan Theories**: No specific fan theories about Episode 517 itself were found. The episode is more about execution than mystery, so theories focus on broader timeskip implications rather than this specific episode.

### Notable Production Details
- Director: Hiroaki Miyamoto
- Screenplay: Hirohiko Kamisaka
- Art Director: Ryūji Yoshiike
- Animation Director: Kazuya Hisada
- TV Rating: 11.1% (ranked 2nd in time slot)

### Cultural Impact

- Episode has 9.1 rating on IMDb

- "We Go!" opening became iconic for post-timeskip era

### Data Quality Notes

### Recommendations for Future Research

## Additional Notes

This episode is primarily a setup episode that:
1. Reintroduces all main characters with new designs
2. Establishes the Fake Straw Hat conflict
3. Sets up the reunion that will complete in following episodes

The episode itself is light on action but heavy on character moments and setup. Most significant events will pay off in Episodes 518-522.

The absence of an ending theme (removed since Episode 279) was confirmed - the anime didn't use ending themes from 2006-2023.
