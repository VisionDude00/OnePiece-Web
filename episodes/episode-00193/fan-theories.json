    "theoryText": "Based on Enel's departure to the moon in Episode 193 and recent manga revelations, fans theorize that Enel will return during One Piece's final saga. The theory gained traction after Chapter 1114 revealed hieroglyphs that match what Enel discovered on the moon during his cover story, particularly imagery related to the Mother Flame. Since the moon's ancient civilization appears connected to the Void Century and the series' ultimate mysteries, Enel's knowledge from the moon could make him relevant to the endgame.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the 'Fairy Vearth' or 'Endless Earth' that Enel seeks is not actually the moon, but rather the sunken continent from the Void Century. This theory suggests that Enel's journey to the moon was a misdirection, and he may eventually discover that the true 'endless earth' lies beneath the ocean, possibly connected to the revelation that the world's sea level rose 200 meters during the Void Century.",
