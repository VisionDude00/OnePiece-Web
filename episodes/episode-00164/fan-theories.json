    "summary": "Fans theorize that the Skypiea arc, particularly the revelation about Upper Yard being part of Jaya, contains essential foreshadowing for endgame plot points including the Void Century, ancient weapons, and the true nature of the One Piece.",
    "fullText": "The discovery in Episode 164 that Upper Yard was shot into the sky 400 years ago mirrors many of the series' central mysteries. Fans believe that just as the truth about Noland was hidden and distorted over time, many truths about the Void Century and the ancient kingdom have been similarly obscured. The Poneglyph in Shandora, Robin's presence, and the themes of lost history all point to Skypiea being a microcosm of the series' larger narrative about uncovering forbidden truths.",

    "title": "The Noland-Jaya Connection Proves Ancient Advanced Technology",
    "summary": "The fact that half of Jaya was shot 10,000 meters into the sky suggests the existence of ancient advanced technology or natural phenomena that could be weaponized, similar to the ancient weapons.",
    "fullText": "Episode 164's revelation that Upper Yard was violently separated from Jaya by the Knock Up Stream raises questions about whether this was truly a natural phenomenon or if ancient technology was involved. The sheer force required to launch an island into the sky parallels the destructive power of ancient weapons like Pluton and Poseidon. Some fans theorize that the ancestors may have had technology to harness or create such phenomena, which could explain how islands and civilizations were destroyed during the Void Century.",
