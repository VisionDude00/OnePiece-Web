- Filler nature means less fan theory content available

### Notable Absences
No devil fruits, crews, or major abilities debut in this episode. The focus is entirely on character moments and plot advancement within the filler arc.

### Quality Considerations
- All events have severity ratings (mostly MINOR, one MAJOR for Zoro's hypnosis)
- Cross-references to flashback episodes included (20, 26, 86, 90)
- Multiple external media sources documented
- Character moments kept incremental (only Episode 222 appearances)

## Follow-up Questions
None - research appears complete for this filler episode.
