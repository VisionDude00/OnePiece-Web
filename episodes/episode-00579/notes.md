## Blockers and Questions

### Blockers Encountered:
1. **No complete transcript available**: Could not find a full word-for-word script for Episode 579. This limited the ability to capture exact dialogue and precise event descriptions.

2. **Timestamp accuracy**: Without access to the actual episode video, all timestamps are estimates based on typical episode structure and event descriptions from summaries.

3. **Limited YouTube content**: Search results did not return many YouTube-specific videos for this episode. Most video reactions appear to be on Bilibili or other platforms.

4. **Voice actor gaps**: Could not identify the animation director or key animators for this specific episode. Dragon Number Thirteen's voice actor (if any) is also unknown.

### Questions for Human Review:
1. Should timestamps be verified with the actual episode for accuracy?
2. Are estimated timestamps acceptable for this research, or is exact timing required?
3. Should I attempt to locate and watch the actual episode for more detailed event descriptions?
4. Are Bilibili video reactions acceptable external media, or should the search focus more on YouTube/podcasts?
