    "theoryText": "After Episode 339, viewers theorized about the identity of the person who stole Brook's shadow. The theory suggested it would be a powerful swordsman since Brook is a skilled fencer, and that the shadow thief would be one of the main antagonists on Thriller Bark.

The theory posits that Brook's 50-year isolation and grief over his crew's death manifested as a shadow that prevents him from experiencing joy and sunlight, making the battle to reclaim his shadow a metaphor for overcoming depression.",
