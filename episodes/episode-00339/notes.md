3. **Web Search Issues:** Encountered some web search errors during research, limiting access to some external media sources.
4. **Voice Actor Data:** Some voice actor information was incomplete, particularly for minor characters like Cerberus.

## Key Findings

1. **Absalom** - First appearance using Suke Suke no Mi powers (invisible attack)
2. **Hildon** - Bat-like vampire zombie, messenger for the Mysterious Four
3. **Cerberus** - Three-headed zombie dog with one fox head

## Data Quality Notes

## Notable Observations

1. **No Ending Song:** Episode 339 aired after One Piece stopped using ending themes following Episode 278, so there is no ending song for this episode.

2. **Mini Merry II Significance:** This vessel becomes important throughout the series for exploration and evacuation, making its debut significant beyond just this episode.

3. **Absalom's Powers:** While his invisibility is demonstrated, Absalom himself is not visually revealed, creating mystery about his identity.

4. **Brook's Water Running:** First time we see Brook's unique ability to run on water due to his lightweight skeleton body.

5. **Thriller Bark Scale:** The episode emphasizes that Thriller Bark is the world's largest ship, setting up the grand scale of the arc.

## External Media Findings

- **Bilibili** - Combined Episodes 339-340 reaction

### Written Content

### Limited YouTube Presence

2. **Brook's Shadow Symbolism:** Analysis of shadow as metaphor for depression
3. **Hogback's Dark Secret:** Immediate fan suspicion about Hogback's ethics (later confirmed)
