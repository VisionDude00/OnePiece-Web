## Research Challenges

3. **Web Search Issues:** Some searches encountered errors, limiting external media sources
4. **Voice Actor Gaps:** Minor characters like Cerberus lack complete VA information

### Confidence Levels:
- **High Confidence:** Air dates, character debuts, opening song, manga correspondence
- **Medium Confidence:** Dialogue quotes (reconstructed), specific event details
- **Low Confidence:** Exact timestamps, some character nuances

## External Media Found

### Video Content:

- Bilibili (Episodes 339-340 reaction)

### Written Content:
- The Adult Swim Squad (detailed recap with humor)
- Never Watched One Piece (first-time viewer perspective)

### Limited Coverage:
Due to the episode's age (2008) and web search limitations, YouTube content was sparse compared to newer episodes.

## Fan Theory Highlights

1. **Thriller Bark-God Valley Connection** - Theory linking West Blue origin to God Valley
2. **Brook's Shadow as Depression** - Symbolic analysis of shadow representing grief
3. **Hogback's Dark Secret** - Immediate fan suspicion (later confirmed)
4. **Shadow Thief Identity** - Speculation about who stole Brook's shadow

## Episode Significance

**Rating: 8/10**

- Gateway episode to full Thriller Bark arc
- Multiple important character debuts
- Sets up major character arcs (Chopper/Hogback, Brook/shadow)
- Introduces key plot device (Mini Merry II)
