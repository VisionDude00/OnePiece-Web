    "summary": "The introduction of Dorry and Brogy in Little Garden serves as long-term foreshadowing for the eventual Elbaf arc, where the Straw Hats will visit the legendary giant homeland.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that the Little Garden arc (starting with Episode 70) was intentional foreshadowing by Oda for the Elbaf arc that would come much later in the series. Usopp's fascination with the giants' warrior pride and his expressed desire to visit Elbaf sets up a future storyline. The introduction of giant culture, their honor system, and references to their homeland establish world-building that pays off hundreds of chapters later. Episode 70's debut of the prehistoric island and its giant inhabitants plants seeds for one of the most anticipated future arcs in One Piece.",

    "fullText": "Fans theorize that the giants of Elbaf, including Dorry and Brogy introduced in Episode 70, have historical knowledge of the Sun God Nika. The Winter Solstice Festival celebrated in Elbaf celebrates 'the death and rebirth of the sun' which could be connected to Nika worship. Later in the story, Dorry and Brogy refer to Luffy as the Sun God, suggesting the giants recognized his Gear Five form and understood its significance. This theory proposes that Little Garden's introduction of giant culture was setting up their eventual role in the Nika/Joy Boy storyline that becomes central to One Piece's endgame.",

    "fullText": "Reddit user u/Mr_anonymous2007 theorized that Elbaf might have a way that leads to the Sky Islands, inspired by Norse mythology. In Norse myths, Yggdrasil is a giant tree that connects different realms including Asgard in the sky. Given One Piece's use of mythology and the introduction of giants in Episode 70's Little Garden arc, this theory suggests that Elbaf will feature a massive tree or similar structure connecting to sky islands. This would tie together the giant culture introduced in Little Garden with the sky island mythology established in the Skypiea arc, creating a larger interconnected world-building narrative.",

    "fullText": "While Zoro and Sanji had friction before, Episode 70's hunting competition on Little Garden is seen by fans as the 'official' start of their legendary rivalry. The competition to see who can hunt the biggest dinosaur establishes the pattern that will repeat throughout One Piece: Zoro and Sanji competing over trivial matters while maintaining mutual respect as fighters. Some fans theorize this was intentionally designed by Oda to create a dynamic similar to Dorry and Brogy's century-long duel - two strong warriors with deep respect for each other who can't help but compete. The parallel between the giants' honorable combat and Zoro/Sanji's bickering suggests this rivalry will continue throughout the entire series.",

The island being 'frozen in time' at a prehistoric state, combined with the presence of ancient warriors like Dorry and Brogy who have been there for 100 years, suggests the island may be connected to the Void Century or other ancient mysteries. Some theorists propose that islands with longer Log Pose times are closer to important historical sites or contain remnants of the ancient kingdom. This theory gains weight when considering other significant islands in the Grand Line also have unusual magnetic properties.",
