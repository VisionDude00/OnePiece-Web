    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Usopp's natural pessimism and his ability to imagine worst-case scenarios is actually a very early form of or precursor to Observation Haki. His immunity to Perona's Negative Hollows comes from his mind already being 'trained' to handle negative thoughts, which could relate to the mental discipline required for Haki.",

    "title": "Usopp vs Perona Mirrors Luffy vs Enel",
    "theory": "Fans widely note that Usopp being Perona's natural enemy due to his negative personality directly parallels Luffy being Enel's natural enemy due to his rubber body. Both situations show that the 'invincible' Devil Fruit user has a natural counter that exists not through power, but through inherent traits. This is seen as Oda's commentary that there's no such thing as an 'invincible' power - everything has a weakness.",

    "theory": "Some fans interpret the Usopp vs Perona fight as Oda's commentary on mental health and depression. Usopp's immunity comes from accepting his negative thoughts rather than fighting them, suggesting that acknowledgment and acceptance of one's flaws can be a strength. Perona's power represents how depression affects those who aren't prepared for it, while Usopp shows that those who've already dealt with self-doubt have built-in resilience.",

After his defeat by Luffy at Water 7 and his struggles during Enies Lobby, Usopp was at his lowest point mentally. This fight proves that hitting rock bottom has made him stronger in unexpected ways, and sets up his future growth as a brave warrior of the sea. His willingness to fight Perona alone shows he's regaining his confidence.",
