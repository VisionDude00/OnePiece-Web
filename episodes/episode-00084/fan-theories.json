    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Chopper's Devil Fruit is actually the mythical Zoan-type Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Bigfoot, rather than the standard Human model. The key evidence includes: (1) In none of Chopper's full transformations does he become a full human - he always has his signature blue nose and a furry coat, unlike other Zoan users who fully transform; (2) Bigfoot is described as a legendary giant creature with human attributes but covered in thick fur like animals in cold regions, which matches Chopper perfectly; (3) This would explain why Chopper was born with a blue nose - it wasn't a natural mutation, but a sign he was destined for this specific mythical fruit. This theory gained traction after the revelation about Luffy's true Devil Fruit being a mythical model rather than standard.",

    "theoryTitle": "Hiriluk's Cherry Blossoms Connect to God Valley",
    "theoryText": "Dr. Hiriluk mentioned being miraculously cured of a deadly disease by cherry blossoms on a mountain in 'a faraway land in the West'. Chapter 1095 later confirmed that God Valley was in the West Blue. Fans theorize that Hiriluk witnessed the cherry blossoms on God Valley before it disappeared, and this experience is what inspired his dream to cure Drum Kingdom's 'frozen heart' with cherry blossoms. This could connect Hiriluk's backstory to one of the series' greatest mysteries and explain the profound impact those cherry blossoms had on him. The theory suggests that whatever happened on God Valley - possibly the liberation or revolution that occurred there - is symbolically connected to Hiriluk's philosophy about curing people's hearts.",

    "theoryTitle": "Chopper's Blue Nose Signifies D Clan Connection",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Chopper's blue nose, which caused him to be rejected and is explicitly unusual even for reindeer, might signify some connection to the Will of D or a deeper destiny in the One Piece world. The theory points to how cherry blossoms (sakura) are symbolically connected to the 'D' clan throughout the series, and Chopper's entire arc revolves around cherry blossoms through Hiriluk's legacy. The unusual blue nose that marked him as 'special' from birth, combined with his eventual role as the doctor who will help Luffy achieve his dream, suggests he may have a greater destiny than being a random reindeer who ate a Devil Fruit. This is supported by the symbolic and esoteric analysis of Volume 17, which heavily features cherry blossom and 'D' symbolism.",
