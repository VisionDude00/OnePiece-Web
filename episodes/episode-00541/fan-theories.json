    "fullText": "Chapter 1167 of the One Piece manga revealed that Fisher Tiger ran into Shanks 15 years before the current timeline when Shanks had gone undercover as a candidate for the Knights of God. Shanks assisted Tiger by allowing him access to the Holy Land's armory. This revelation recontextualizes the events of episode 541, suggesting that Tiger's successful attack on Mary Geoise may have been partially enabled by Shanks' intervention. Some fans theorize that Shanks may have been moved by Tiger's cause or had his own reasons for wanting to free the slaves. This connection deepens the relationship between fish-men and certain powerful human figures in the One Piece world.",

    "fullText": "One popular fan theory suggests that Fisher Tiger's successful infiltration and slave liberation at Mary Geoise was possible because he timed it during a specific window when the God's Knights were away participating in their triennial hunting event. As a former slave himself, Tiger would have been aware of the routines and schedules of the Celestial Dragons and their protectors. This theory explains how he was able to accomplish such a daring feat at the heart of World Government power. The theory gained traction after manga revelations about the God's Knights and their role in protecting the Celestial Dragons.",

    "summary": "Eiichiro Oda himself revealed that Koala represents the positive outcome of Fisher Tiger's actions while Hody Jones represents the negative, showing how Tiger's death impacted different people.",
    "fullText": "In SBS Volume 75, Eiichiro Oda directly confirmed that Koala is a meaningful character who lives a life completely opposite to Hody Jones. While Hody became consumed by hatred and racism despite never experiencing human cruelty firsthand, Koala - who was enslaved and traumatized by humans - was saved by Fisher Tiger and went on to join the Revolutionary Army, fighting for equality and freedom for all races including fish-men. This thematic contrast demonstrates that Fisher Tiger's sacrifice and good deeds were not in vain. Koala's introduction in episode 541 thus represents hope for reconciliation between humans and fish-men, while Hody (introduced earlier in the arc) represents the perpetuation of hatred. Fans have noted that this makes Koala's emotional scenes in episode 541 even more significant, as she represents the possibility of breaking the cycle of hatred that Tiger himself struggled with.",

    "summary": "Fisher Tiger's confession to Jinbe about having demons that wish to kill humans directly foreshadows his death, where he refuses human blood transfusion.",
    "fullText": "Episode 541 features a crucial moment where Fisher Tiger privately confesses to Jinbe that despite his public philosophy of liberation over revenge, he has 'demons inside him that wish to kill humans.' This confession is a clear piece of foreshadowing for episode 544, where Tiger is mortally wounded but refuses a human blood transfusion - not for logical reasons, but because he cannot psychologically overcome his trauma-induced hatred of humans. Fans have noted that this makes Tiger's heroic actions in episode 541, particularly his compassion toward Koala, even more remarkable. He fights against his own demons to provide genuine liberation and compassion to a human child, even though those same demons will ultimately lead to his death. The theory emphasizes that Tiger's tragedy is not just his death, but the fact that despite his heroic ideals and actions, he could never fully heal from his own trauma. This internal conflict makes him one of One Piece's most complex and tragic characters.",
