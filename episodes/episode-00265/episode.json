Standing over 50 feet tall, these formidable guardians have protected the government facility for 50 years. They mock the comparatively tiny invaders and prepare to defend the gates, presenting an overwhelming obstacle to the rescue mission.",
      "significance": "The introduction of Kashii and Oimo raises the stakes dramatically, as giants are known to possess enormous strength capable of easily defeating normal-sized humans.

      "significance": "This revelation exposes the World Government's willingness to use deception and manipulation to gain loyal servants.

However, despite their impressive size by human standards (reaching up to the giants' knees), they are completely outmatched by the true giants' strength.",
      "significance": "This confrontation demonstrates the enormous power gap between even the largest humans and true giants.
