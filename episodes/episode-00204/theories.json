This plays on the mysterious and powerful D. clan that includes characters like Monkey D. Luffy and Gol D. Roger. Fans create elaborate jokes about Condoriano being the strongest character in One Piece or a secret 10th member of the Straw Hat crew.",

The theory suggests that the arc's quality, character development, Jonathan's brilliance as an antagonist, and natural flow from Skypiea make it worthy of canon status. Some fans believe Oda may have consulted on the arc's creation given its seamless integration with canon elements.",
