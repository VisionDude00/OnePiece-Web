    "summary": "The Going Merry developed a Klabautermann (ship spirit) from being well-loved and cared for by the crew, especially Usopp. This spirit was responsible for repairing the ship in Skypiea and will later play a crucial role in the Water 7 arc.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that the Going Merry, through the love and care shown by the Straw Hats (particularly Usopp), manifested a Klabautermann - a water spirit from maritime folklore that dwells in ships. This spirit is visible only to those who deeply care for their ship and appears as a child in a sailor's raincoat. The Klabautermann was seen by Usopp repairing the ship in Skypiea, and in Water 7, it begged Iceburg to fix the ship just enough for one final voyage. The theory suggests that the ship gained sentience and a will of its own, allowing it to perform miracles like sailing from Water 7 to Enies Lobby on its own. This adds a supernatural and emotional layer to the eventual farewell to the Going Merry, making it not just the loss of a ship but the death of a crew member.",

    "summary": "Among all the Straw Hats, Usopp's unique bond with the Going Merry was the key factor that allowed the ship to manifest a Klabautermann and perform miraculous feats.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that while all the Straw Hats cared for the Going Merry, it was specifically Usopp's deep love and care for the ship that enabled it to develop a Klabautermann. As the crew member who maintained and repaired the ship throughout their journey, Usopp formed the strongest bond with the Merry. This is evidenced by Usopp being the one to see the Klabautermann repairing the ship in Skypiea, and his fierce defense of the ship in Water 7 even after being told it's irreparable. The theory suggests that Usopp's emotional connection and his role as the ship's caretaker created the conditions for the ship to gain sentience. This makes the eventual conflict between Luffy and Usopp over the Going Merry even more tragic, as Usopp isn't just defending a ship - he's defending what he considers a living crew member.",

    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that the Klabautermann manifestation in ships like the Going Merry might have deeper connections to the One Piece world's ancient history and Joy Boy. This theory proposes that the ability for ships to develop spirits and consciousness might be related to ancient powers or abilities that Joy Boy possessed or created. The theory draws parallels between the Going Merry's eventual sacrifice to save the crew and other themes of inherited will and the power of dreams in One Piece. While this is a more speculative theory with less direct evidence, it attempts to connect the Klabautermann phenomenon to the larger mythology of the One Piece world rather than treating it as an isolated supernatural occurrence.",

    "fullText": "This theory suggests that Franky, even from his first appearance, was evaluating the Straw Hat Pirates to see if they were worthy of note. By stealing their money and beating up Usopp, he forced the crew into a situation where they had to show their true character - would they give up, seek help from authorities, or fight back on their own terms? The fact that the Straw Hats came to Franky House ready to fight demonstrated their strength and loyalty to each other. Later interactions show Franky respecting Usopp's dedication to the Going Merry, suggesting he was always observing their bonds. While this is more headcanon than confirmed theory, it provides an alternative reading of Franky's initial antagonistic actions as part of his assessment of potential allies rather than simple villainy.",
