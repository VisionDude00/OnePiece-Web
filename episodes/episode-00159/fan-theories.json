    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized that the 1,000-year-old ruins Robin examines in Upper Yard are directly connected to the Void Century and may have been part of the ancient kingdom that created the Poneglyphs. The presence of a Poneglyph in Skypiea later confirms the island's importance to ancient history.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorized early on that the priest's 'Mantra' ability (introduced during the Ordeals) was a precursor to what would later be revealed as Observation Haki. This theory suggested that Enel's priests were using an advanced form of observation that would become central to the power system later in the series.",
