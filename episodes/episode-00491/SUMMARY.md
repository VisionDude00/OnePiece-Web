After the devastating Battle of Marineford, Luffy arrives at Amazon Lily aboard the Heart Pirates' submarine, accompanied by Jinbe and Boa Hancock. Upon awakening from unconsciousness, Luffy desperately searches for Ace, destroying the submarine and rampaging through the Amazon Lily forest in denial of his brother's death. Jinbe confronts Luffy and forces him to accept the painful reality that Ace is truly gone, leading to one of the most emotional breakdowns in the series.
