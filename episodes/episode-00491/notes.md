## Final Notes

This episode represents one of the most emotionally powerful moments in One Piece, showing Luffy at his absolute lowest point. The focus on character emotions rather than action makes it unique in the series. The research was comprehensive for plot and character information, though external media coverage was more limited than expected, likely because this aired in 2011 before the current explosion of One Piece content creators.

The episode effectively sets up the flashback arc (Episodes 493-504) that will explore Luffy's childhood with Ace and Sabo, helping viewers understand the depth of his loss.
