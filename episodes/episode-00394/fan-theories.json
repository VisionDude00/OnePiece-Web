    "theoryTitle": "Rayleigh's Protective Instinct Toward Enslaved Girls",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Rayleigh's decision to intervene and protect Camie using his Conqueror's Haki may have been influenced by his history with the Boa sisters (Hancock, Sandersonia, and Marigold). The theory suggests that Rayleigh knew about or encountered the enslaved Boa sisters during their captivity and has since developed a particular soft spot for young girls trapped in the slave trade. This would explain why he breaks his usual passive approach (simply stealing from buyers) to actively protect Camie, describing himself as 'an old man who cannot ignore a pretty girl.'",

The theory suggests he may have had foreknowledge that something significant would happen, possibly through his advanced Observation Haki or connections to the underworld. This would explain why the legendary 'Dark King' was so conveniently present when the Straw Hats needed help most.",
