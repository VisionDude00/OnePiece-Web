    "fullText": "Fans have theorized about why Blackbeard and his crew didn't steal Magellan's extremely powerful Doku Doku no Mi after their confrontation in Impel Down. Several theories include: (1) They may not have been able to steal it because they need a fruit that resembles the devil fruit, and Blackbeard didn't know Magellan had the poison Devil Fruit before arriving at Impel Down. (2) Blackbeard was on a tight schedule to reach Marineford before the war ended, prioritizing that over obtaining another Devil Fruit. (3) Magellan may not have actually been killed, just defeated, making the fruit unavailable. (4) The poison fruit might not have been compatible with Blackbeard's crew members' fighting styles or strategic needs.",

    "summary": "A theory discussing why Eiichiro Oda made Magellan one of the few arc villains who was never truly defeated by the protagonists.",
    "fullText": "Fans have debated why Magellan remains one of the only major arc antagonists who was never actually defeated in combat. Theories include: (1) Magellan represents an insurmountable obstacle that highlights the difference between brute force and strategic escape - Luffy didn't need to defeat him, just outsmart him. (2) Oda wanted to establish that not every problem can be solved with fighting, teaching Luffy an important lesson about survival versus victory. (3) Magellan's poison abilities are so overpowered that defeating him would require specific counters (like Mr. 3's wax) rather than raw strength, making him a unique challenge. (4) Leaving Magellan undefeated adds realism to the world - not every strong character needs to lose to prove the protagonist's growth. (5) It sets up potential future encounters where Luffy might need to face Magellan again with better preparation.",

    "summary": "A theory that highlights Magellan as one of the strongest characters in One Piece, having defeated Luffy, Blackbeard's crew, and Jinbe - three individuals who would later become or associate with Emperors.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Magellan is actually one of the most underrated powerful characters in One Piece. During the Impel Down arc, he defeated: (1) Monkey D. Luffy (future Emperor), (2) Members of Blackbeard's crew including their captain (future Emperor), and (3) Jinbe (future helmsman of an Emperor's crew). This theory suggests that Magellan's poison abilities make him nearly Admiral-level in terms of raw combat power, and that only Haki-based resistance or specific Devil Fruit counters (like Mr. 3's wax) can overcome his poison. Some fans argue that if Magellan had Haki or better combat training beyond his Devil Fruit reliance, he could be one of the strongest characters in the series. The theory also suggests that his digestive problems might be Oda's way of nerfing an otherwise overpowered character.",
