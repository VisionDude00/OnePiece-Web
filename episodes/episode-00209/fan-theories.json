    "theoryText": "The Long Ring Long Land arc and the introduction of the Davy Back Fight may be foreshadowing for a future encounter between the Straw Hat Pirates and Shanks' Red Hair Pirates. Rather than having Luffy fight Shanks seriously to become Pirate King, they could settle their rivalry through a Davy Back Fight - a non-lethal competition that would allow them to compete without ill intent. The prize could be the straw hat itself, which technically belongs to both of them, serving as a symbolic passing of the torch.",

Eiichiro Oda rarely wastes narrative space, so the seemingly 'pointless' nature of this arc may be one of his best uses of long-term foreshadowing that won't be apparent until much later in the series.",
