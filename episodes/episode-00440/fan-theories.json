    "theory": "Bon Clay has been absent from the main storyline for 15 years since his sacrifice in Impel Down. A fan theory suggests that Eiichiro Oda is intentionally keeping Bon Clay's return low-key to ensure his comeback will be grand and impactful, potentially as the 10th member of the Straw Hat Pirates. The theory argues that Bon Clay's unwavering friendship, loyalty, and sacrifices for Luffy make him one of the most deserving characters to join the crew.",

    "theory": "After episode 451, many fans theorized about how Bon Clay survived his confrontation with Magellan, the warden with deadly poison powers. The mystery remained until Chapter 666's cover story revealed he was alive as Queen of Newkama Land. Theories include: (1) He used his Mane Mane no Mi powers to impersonate Magellan or another official to escape, (2) He was rescued by remaining Newkama residents, (3) Magellan chose not to kill him out of respect for his loyalty, or (4) He developed immunity to Magellan's poison through repeated exposure.",

Some fans suggest this demonstrates an early example of Conqueror's Haki or willpower affecting physical reality, similar to later reveals about Haki. The theory proposes that belief and willpower in One Piece can literally manifest miracles.",
