December 26, 2025

## Episode Overview
**Title:** The Straw Hats Stunned! The New Fleet Admiral of the Navy!
**Air Date (Japan):** October 28, 2012
**Manga Chapter Adapted:** Chapter 650 (pages 2-17)

## Key Findings

### Major Revelations in This Episode
1. **Shirahoshi is Poseidon** - One of the most significant reveals in the series
2. **Akainu defeated Aokiji** - Ten-day battle on Punk Hazard for Fleet Admiral position
3. **Blackbeard is a Yonko** - Conquered Whitebeard's territories
4. **Punk Hazard's transformation** - First mention of the permanently altered island
5. **Big Mom Pirates debut** - Pekoms and Tamago appear (shadowed)

### Character Debuts
- **Pekoms** (shadowed appearance)
- **Baron Tamago** (shadowed appearance)

### Location Debuts
- **Punk Hazard** (mentioned, not shown)

### Research Challenges
- Episode 570 has relatively slow pacing, adapting only 15 pages of manga
- Most revelations are exposition rather than action
- Exact timestamps are estimated based on episode structure since I don't have access to the actual video
- Some voice actor information for minor characters was not available
- The One Piece Podcast episode 570 found was actually their 570th podcast episode, not about anime episode 570

### Important Context
This episode serves as a crucial bridge between the Fish-Man Island arc and future arcs:
- Sets up the Punk Hazard arc (episodes 579+)
- Establishes the conflict with Big Mom that leads to Whole Cake Island arc
- Reveals crucial information about Ancient Weapons that becomes important in endgame

### Timestamp Estimation Method
Since I couldn't watch the actual episode, timestamps were estimated based on:
- Typical One Piece episode structure (opening ~1:30, recap ~2:00, content ~18:00, preview ~1:00)
- Event ordering from manga chapter and wiki summaries
- Standard pacing for dialogue-heavy episodes
- Events spaced approximately 2-4 minutes apart for major reveals

### Data Quality Notes
- **High Confidence:** Air dates, episode title, manga chapter coverage, major events, character information
- **Medium Confidence:** Exact timestamps, some production credits, engagement metrics
- **Research Gaps:** Complete English voice actor list, exact key animator names, precise viewer engagement for external media

### Notable Observations
1. Episode has a 9.5% viewer rating (ranked 6th) - unusually high for an exposition-heavy episode
2. Heavy focus on world-building and lore rather than action
3. Multiple major plot threads introduced that pay off hundreds of episodes later
4. Caribou knowing about Shirahoshi being Poseidon becomes a recurring plot thread

### Fan Theory Highlights
- Aokiji as SWORD agent theory is very popular
- Speculation about Devil Fruit Awakening shown through Punk Hazard
- Theories about Pluton also being a person like Poseidon
- Joy Boy/Luffy connection theories strengthened by this episode
