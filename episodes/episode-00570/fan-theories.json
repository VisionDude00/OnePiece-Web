    "theoryText": "The prevailing theory states that Kuzan (Aokiji) is secretly allied with SWORD, the secret Marine special forces unit, and is only operating within the ranks of the Blackbeard Pirates to extract information or work towards a currently unknown goal. Some fans believe Aokiji is actually the leader of SWORD, which is why he decided to join the crew of a Yonko, as SWORD's goals revolve around the Yonko. Evidence includes Akainu's suspicious lack of condemnation when the Gorosei mentioned Aokiji's affiliation with Blackbeard, saying 'what he chose has nothing to do with me' instead of expressing outrage.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the ten-day battle between Akainu and Aokiji may have been partially orchestrated or that they reached a secret agreement. The evidence includes the perfectly split nature of Punk Hazard (exactly half ice, half fire) suggesting equal power levels, yet Akainu won. Additionally, Akainu's surprisingly neutral response to Aokiji joining Blackbeard ('what he chose has nothing to do with me') defies his usual Absolute Justice stance. Some theorize that Akainu may have cheated to win, or that the fight was designed to allow Aokiji to leave the Marines with a legitimate cover story for infiltrating Blackbeard's crew.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that the permanent environmental changes to Punk Hazard - one half perpetually frozen and the other eternally burning - are evidence that both Akainu and Aokiji used Devil Fruit Awakening during their ten-day battle. This would be consistent with later revelations about Awakening allowing users to permanently alter their environment. The fact that the changes are permanent rather than temporary suggests Awakening was involved, as normal Devil Fruit powers would dissipate once the user stops using them or is no longer present.",

    "theoryText": "Following the revelation that Poseidon is not an object but a person (Shirahoshi), a popular theory emerged suggesting that Pluton might also be a person rather than the warship described in Alabasta. This theory proposes that Pluton could be someone who possesses the 'Voice of All Things' or another special ability, just like Poseidon. The theory suggests that the blueprints in Water 7 might be instructions for creating conditions for Pluton to manifest, similar to how Poseidon manifests in mermaid princesses every few centuries. This would make all three Ancient Weapons living beings with special inherited abilities.",

    "theoryText": "This theory connects the revelation of Shirahoshi as Poseidon to the prophecy discussed by the Sea Kings about two sovereigns being born. The Sea Kings knew that the new Poseidon would be born in 10 years and would need 15 years to grow - matching Shirahoshi's timeline. They also mentioned another sovereign to be born in a distant sea, which fans believe refers to Luffy as the reincarnation or successor of Joy Boy. The theory suggests that Luffy will fulfill Joy Boy's broken promise to the original Poseidon by helping Shirahoshi use Noah to bring the fish-men and merfolk to the surface, uniting the world. This connects to the recurring theme of inherited will throughout the series.",

    "theoryText": "After overhearing that Shirahoshi is Poseidon in episode 570, fans theorized that Caribou would attempt to sell this information to a major villain, potentially Blackbeard or Kaido. The theory suggests this could lead to a future conflict where villains attempt to capture or kill Shirahoshi to obtain or eliminate the Ancient Weapon. Some variations of the theory suggest Caribou might try to trade this information for protection or a position of power. This theory gained more traction after Caribou appeared in later arcs, keeping the knowledge of Shirahoshi's identity as potential leverage.",
