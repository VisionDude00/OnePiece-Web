    "theory": "Many fans theorized that Vegapunk intentionally labeled the artificial Devil Fruit as a 'failure' to prevent the World Government from discovering he had successfully created a replica of a Mythical Zoan fruit. If they knew he could mass-produce such powerful fruits, they would exploit this technology for military purposes. The 'wrong color' excuse was a deliberate deception to protect his research from misuse.",
    "evidence": [
      "The fruit functions perfectly despite being called a failure",
      "Vegapunk has shown moral concerns about his inventions being weaponized",
      "The only stated defect is cosmetic (pink vs blue color)",

    "status": "CONFIRMED",
    "statusNotes": "Later confirmed in Chapter 1069 that Vegapunk called it a failure only due to color, but fan theories about his reasoning were partially validated - he did have concerns about his creations.",

    "theory": "When Episode 611 revealed that Momonosuke's artificial fruit was created using Kaido's lineage factor, fans immediately theorized this would create a thematic connection between Momonosuke and Kaido that would become important in the Wano arc.
