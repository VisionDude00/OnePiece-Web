# Research Notes for One Piece Episode 105

## Episode Overview
**Title:** "The Battlefront of Alabasta! Rainbase, the City of Dreams!"
**Air Date:** March 17, 2002 (Japan)
**Arc:** Arabasta Arc
**Manga Chapters:** 167-168

## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
- One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Primary source for episode details
- Manga chapters 167-168 for canonical story beats
- Character wiki pages for Pell, Chaka, Cobra, Smoker, Tashigi, Crocodile, Robin
- Location wiki pages for Rainbase and Rain Dinners
- Voice actor databases (Behind The Voice Actors)

### Key Research Findings

#### Episode Structure
This episode serves as a crucial setup episode with three parallel storylines:
1. **Straw Hats' Journey** - Traveling to and arriving in Rainbase
2. **Palace Storyline** - King Cobra learning the truth and preparing to attack
3. **Crocodile's Trap** - The antagonist preparing to capture the heroes

#### Character Debuts vs. Appearances
- **Note:** While researching, I found that Pell, Chaka, and Cobra all debuted in Episode 91
- However, Episode 105 features significant character moments for all three
- The wiki indicated this was a more formal introduction for these characters in terms of their strategic roles

#### Timestamp Estimation
- Exact timestamps were estimated based on typical episode structure:
  - Opening/recap: 0:00-2:00
  - First act: 2:00-8:00 (Vivi's decision, journey scenes)
  - Second act: 8:00-13:00 (Palace scenes with Cobra)
  - Third act: 13:00-20:00 (Rainbase arrival, Smoker encounter, chase)
  - Fourth act: 20:00-22:00 (Rain Dinners arrival, Crocodile's trap)
  - Ending: 22:00-23:30

#### Location Research
**Rainbase:**
- First appeared in Episode 76, not 105
- Known as "City of Dreams" due to casino culture
- Prospered during drought (suspicious and later explained by Crocodile's machinations)
- Contains multiple casinos: Golden Slots, Loose Slots, Royale, Fantasia, Coin Banditts
- Features a large oasis lake with Bananawani (crocodile-like creatures)

**Rain Dinners:**
- Pyramid-shaped building with golden crocodile statue
- Owned by Crocodile
- Managed by Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday)
- Contains secret basement headquarters
- Central location for upcoming confrontation

#### Opening and Ending Songs
- **Opening:** "Believe" by Folder5 (Episodes 48-115) - 69 episodes total, making it the 2nd opening
- **Ending:** "fish" by The Kaleidoscope (Episodes 95-106) - Only 12 episodes, making it the 6th ending and one of the shortest-running

#### Voice Actor Notes
Multiple English voice actors exist for characters due to different dubs:
- 4Kids Entertainment dub (heavily edited)
- Funimation dub (more faithful to original)
- ODEX dub (Southeast Asia)

Listed Funimation actors as primary English dub for consistency.

## Story Significance

### Thematic Elements
1. **Truth vs. Deception** - Vivi's letter reveals truth to Cobra while Crocodile maintains his deception
2. **Chaos vs. Planning** - Multiple factions have plans that collide chaotically
3. **Trap and Counter-Trap** - Crocodile has anticipated the heroes' moves

### Character Development Highlights
- **Vivi:** Shows strategic maturity in changing plans
- **Luffy:** Displays both maturity (respecting Toto's water) and recklessness (encountering Smoker)
- **Cobra:** Demonstrates decisive leadership
- **Crocodile:** Reveals strategic superiority and confidence

### Foreshadowing
- Crocodile's trap setup foreshadows upcoming cage/betrayal arc
- Smoker's independent investigation foreshadows his recurring role as "good Marine"
- Robin's presence hints at her eventual role change

## Final Notes

This episode serves as a masterful setup for the Alabasta Arc's climax. The parallel storylines of the Straw Hats, King Cobra, and Crocodile all converge on Rainbase, creating a sense of inevitable confrontation. The comedy of Luffy accidentally sitting next to Smoker provides levity while also raising the stakes.

The episode demonstrates Oda's skill at juggling multiple plot threads while maintaining narrative momentum. Every scene serves a purpose in building tension toward the upcoming confrontation.
