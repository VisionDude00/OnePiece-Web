    "summary": "Fans theorize that Chopper's new Kung Fu Point transformation is actually a combination of his pre-timeskip Arm Point and Jump Point forms.",
    "fullText": "Most fans believe that Chopper combined his two pre-timeskip forms, Arm Point and Jump Point, into Kung Fu Point. The form seems to combine the power of Arm Point with the acrobatic skill of Jumping Point, though to a lesser degree than each individual point. This theory is supported by the fact that these two forms disappeared after the timeskip, while Kung Fu Point emerged with characteristics of both: enhanced combat power and versatile, agile movement. The training Chopper underwent on Torino Kingdom with its human inhabitants likely taught him how to merge these forms into a more efficient combat transformation.",

    "fullText": "Some fans theorized that Vander Decken IX would eventually join the Straw Hat Pirates, with the reasoning that he had a traumatic past stemming from being the only known Fish-Man to consume a Devil Fruit, making him a pariah among his people. The theory suggested he would have a heel-face turn and back out of his deal with Hody Jones after realizing the error of his ways. However, this theory was ultimately disproven as Vander Decken remained an antagonist throughout the arc and never showed any inclination toward redemption or joining Luffy's crew.",

    "summary": "A theory that the Straw Hats taking Neptune hostage played directly into Hody Jones' larger plan to turn Fish-Man Island against humans.",
    "fullText": "Some fans believe that the circumstances forcing the Straw Hats to take King Neptune hostage were not entirely accidental, but rather played perfectly into Hody Jones' master plan. By creating a situation where the Straw Hats appeared as criminals who attacked the royal palace, Hody could use this as propaganda to fuel anti-human sentiment on Fish-Man Island. The theory suggests that Hody may have anticipated or even orchestrated events to push the Straw Hats into a corner, knowing their survival instincts would force them to take drastic measures that would make them look like villains. This would support his narrative that humans are dangerous and cannot be trusted, making it easier to rally Fish-Men to his cause.",
