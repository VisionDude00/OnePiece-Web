    "theoryText": "The Z's Ambition Arc (episodes 575-578) was specifically created to introduce characters and plot elements that would appear in One Piece Film Z. The arc serves as a prologue to enhance the movie experience by establishing Z, Ain, and Binz before their major roles in the film. This allows viewers to have more emotional investment in the film's climax and understand Z's motivations better.",

The organization's willingness to oppose the World Government and use weapons of mass destruction (Dyna Stones) shows how far Z has fallen from his original ideals as a Marine admiral.",

This suggests that not all members are united in their cause, with some like Shuzo being motivated more by personal advancement than ideology.",
