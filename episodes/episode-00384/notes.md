## Cross-References
This episode connects to:
- **Episode 381**: Brook officially joins the crew
- **Episodes 377-378**: Bink's Sake backstory with Rumbar Pirates
- **Episodes 269-280, 309, 312**: Enies Lobby arc (Robin's rescue, referenced in this episode)

## Notable Absences
- No devil fruit debuts

## Personal Observations
This episode exemplifies how well-executed filler can enhance character development beyond the manga's scope. The parallel between Robin and Brook's experiences of finding belonging creates a touching moment that enriches both characters. The episode's focus on emotional truth over action makes it memorable despite its non-canon status.
