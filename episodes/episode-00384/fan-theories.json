    "theoryText": "Episode 384 deliberately parallels Robin and Brook's experiences as outcasts who found family with the Straw Hats. Both characters had dark, lonely pasts and struggled with feeling worthy of the crew's acceptance. Robin's reference to Enies Lobby when consoling Brook suggests the writers intended to draw this parallel, making Brook the spiritual successor to Robin's arc.",
