    "summary": "Fan theory that Energy Steroids were an ancient attempt by Fish-Man Island to replicate the Minks' Sulong transformation, resulting in a failed version with dangerous side effects.",
    "fullText": "After seeing the Minks' Sulong transformation (white fur, red eyes), fans noticed striking similarities to Hody Jones' Energy Steroid transformation. The theory proposes that ancient Fish-Man Island may have tried to copy the Minks' Sulong transformation, and the Energy Steroids were a failed attempt to give fish-men their own transformation, with accelerated aging as an unintended side effect. This is supported by the fact that Hody eventually transformed and got white hair with intense aging as the side effect - mirroring aspects of the Sulong form.",

    "summary": "Theory that Luffy will destroy Fish-Man Island as prophesied by Madam Shyarly, not as an act of destruction but to free the fish-men and merfolk to live on the surface under the real sun.",
    "fullText": "During the Fishman Island Arc, Madam Shyarly made a prediction that Luffy would be responsible for the destruction of Fish-Man Island, and her predictions are never wrong. The theory proposes that Fishman Island is not the ideal place for the Fishmen and Merfolk to live, and the people of Fishman Island themselves want to live on the surface under the real sun. The prophecy makes sense if Luffy will be forced to destroy the island (possibly by destroying the Red Line), and once gone, the Fishmen will be able to live freely on the surface world, fulfilling Joy Boy's ancient promise to them. This connects to Neptune's introduction in episode 530 and the deeper lore about Fish-Man Island's relationship with the surface world.",

    "summary": "Analysis that Hody Jones was created to represent how racism and hatred can be inherited and amplified without any personal negative experience, making him a symbol of baseless prejudice.",
    "fullText": "According to creator Eiichiro Oda, Hody Jones was created to highlight baseless racism in One Piece and the real world. Unlike Fisher Tiger and Arlong who had legitimate grievances against humans (Tiger was enslaved, Arlong witnessed Tiger's death), Hody's hatred was revealed to be 'inherited hatred' - he took the hatred around him into his heart, nurtured it, and went insane with it, despite never personally experiencing human cruelty. This makes his declaration in episode 530 that he will succeed where Fisher Tiger and Arlong failed particularly tragic, as he fundamentally misunderstands their struggles and is driven purely by ideology rather than experience. His reliance on Energy Steroids symbolizes how his power is artificial and unsustainable, just like his hatred.",

    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that the Energy Steroids from the Tamatebako could have originated from the Ancient Kingdom, given Fish-Man Island's connection to Joy Boy and the apology letter he left on the island. Forum discussions note it's 'weird that energy steroids look so similar to mink sulong + gear 5', with some users even speculating the steroids might contain energy from the Moon or be connected to ancient technology. The introduction of Energy Steroids in episode 530 takes on greater significance if they are indeed ancient artifacts rather than modern creations, potentially tying into the broader mysteries of the Void Century.",
