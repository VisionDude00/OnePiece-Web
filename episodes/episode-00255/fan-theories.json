    "theoryTitle": "Enies Lobby and Lulusia Connection - Ancient Weapon Theory",
    "theoryText": "The hole beneath Enies Lobby was created by the same ancient weapon (Uranus) that destroyed Lulusia. This theory suggests that in the past, someone used Uranus to wipe out a country that stood where Enies Lobby is now located, creating the bottomless pit. The destruction of Lulusia in the modern timeline using Mother Flame creates a similar hole, proving that both locations were victims of the same type of ancient weapon attack.",

    "theoryTitle": "Water 7 Sinking Connected to Enies Lobby Destruction",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Water 7's gradual sinking over centuries is connected to the ancient destruction that created the hole under Enies Lobby. The theory suggests that the weapon that destroyed the original island where Enies Lobby stands caused geological changes that affect neighboring Water 7, causing it to slowly sink below sea level. However, this theory is challenged by the fact that Water 7's sinking is canonically linked to the Aqua Laguna phenomenon, making this connection potentially coincidental rather than causal.",

    "theoryText": "Admiral Aokiji (Kuzan) admitted to Nico Robin that he orchestrated the events leading to Enies Lobby because he felt Robin was too much of a wild card with her constant wandering and inability to settle with a group. By forcing the situation, he tested whether the Straw Hats were truly capable of protecting Robin and whether she had finally found a crew worth staying with. This theory is partially confirmed by Aokiji's own admission but raises questions about how much of the Water 7 arc he influenced.",

    "theoryText": "The Rocketman's inability to be controlled or stopped serves as a metaphor for Luffy and the Straw Hats' unstoppable determination. Just as the Rocketman was deemed 'too dangerous' and locked away, the Straw Hats are considered dangerous by the World Government. The fact that this 'dangerous' train becomes the key to rescuing Robin symbolizes how the crew's 'dangerous' nature is actually their greatest strength - their refusal to stop or slow down when their friends are in danger.",
