### Manga Adaptation Notes

### Additional Observations
1. **Episode Pacing**: This episode serves as a "preparation" episode, methodically showing the assembly of the rescue party and the acquisition of transportation. The pacing is deliberate, building anticipation for the journey ahead.

2. **Emotional Tone**: The episode balances determination and hope with underlying tension about the dangerous mission ahead. The Aqua Laguna storm serves as both literal and metaphorical obstacle.

3. **Character Relationships**: First meeting between Sanji and Franky is comedic but significant, establishing their dynamic before Franky eventually joins the crew.

4. **World Building**: The episode expands on Tom's legacy through the Rocketman, showing another creation beyond the Puffing Tom. This reinforces Tom's importance to Water 7's history.

5. **Animation Quality**: Standard quality for this arc, with focus on character expressions and the dramatic reveal of the Rocketman rather than action sequences.

6. **Cultural Impact**: The Rocketman has become an iconic vehicle in One Piece, memorable for its shark-like design and role in the rescue mission. Frequently appears in fan art and discussions.

## Recommendations for Future Research
- Seek out Japanese fan discussions for additional cultural perspective
- Look for staff interviews about the Rocketman's design process
- Find more detailed episode scripts if available
- Search for animator notes or production materials
- Investigate fan art and creative works inspired by this episode

## Questions for Human Review
- Are the timestamp estimates reasonable for a standard 23-minute episode?
- Should more details be added about the Franky Family members individually?
- Is the severity rating for T Bone's debut appropriate (MAJOR vs MINOR)?
- Should Spandam's scene at Enies Lobby be expanded into separate events?
