    "theoryText": "The fact that Crocodile explicitly states he 'never trusted Robin from the beginning' suggests he may have been betrayed by a partner or ally in the past. This could explain his inability to trust anyone and his ruthless nature when dealing with subordinates. Some fans theorize someone significant betrayed Crocodile before he became a Warlord, shaping his paranoid and calculating personality.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Robin never intended to give Crocodile the information about Pluton, even if the Poneglyph had contained it. Her motivation for joining Baroque Works was solely to access the Poneglyph for her own research about the Void Century. The theory suggests she had a backup plan ready, knowing Crocodile would eventually try to kill her. This explains why she wasn't more surprised or desperate when he stabbed her.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Arabasta Poneglyph was altered or that there's a second, hidden Poneglyph in Alabasta that does contain Pluton's location. This theory arose from the apparent contradiction between the Arabasta arc suggesting Pluton was in Alabasta and later revelations placing it in Wano. Proponents argue that either Robin lied about the contents, Cobra's ancestors altered it, or Oda changed the plot.",

    "theoryText": "A popular theory suggests that Crocodile's bomb wasn't just meant to cause chaos - it was strategically placed to excavate and reveal Pluton if it was buried beneath Alubarna. According to this theory, Crocodile had already deduced that Pluton was somewhere under the capital city, and hiring Robin was partly a backup plan. If she couldn't read the exact location, the bomb would do the work by destroying the upper layers and revealing what was beneath.",

Observing Luffy's determination and his crew's loyalty throughout their battles in Alabasta, Robin may have planned to use the Straw Hats as her escape route from Crocodile. This would explain why she later saves Luffy with the antidote and asks to join the crew - it wasn't a spontaneous decision but a calculated survival strategy she'd been considering since Episode 123.",

This theory argues that the Ancient Weapons are all people with the ability to control incredibly powerful forces. According to this interpretation, the Arabasta Poneglyph not mentioning Pluton could mean the 'weapon' hadn't been born yet in Alabasta, or that Robin was protecting this secret from Crocodile.",
