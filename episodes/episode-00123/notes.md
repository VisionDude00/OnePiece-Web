### Timestamp Estimation Notes
Since exact timestamps weren't available in sources, I estimated based on:
- Typical One Piece episode structure (2 min recap, 1.5 min opening, ~18 min content, 1.5 min ending)
- Standard pacing for the Arabasta Arc
- Logical flow of events from plot summaries

Estimated timestamps:
- 03:45 - Luffy's revival (early episode, after recap/opening)
- 06:30 - Tashigi scene (following Luffy's recovery)
- 09:15 - Crocodile arrives at tomb (building tension)
- 12:45 - Poneglyph reading (mid-episode major scene)
- 14:20 - Crocodile stabs Robin (critical moment)
- 16:00 - Cobra activates self-destruct (raising stakes)
- 18:30 - Luffy's chase begins (late episode setup)
- 20:00 - Straw Hats searching for bomb (parallel subplot)

### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Episode Script Access:** Could not find a full transcript of Episode 123, so relied on plot summaries and wiki information

2. **Timestamp Accuracy:** Exact timestamps not available in sources, had to estimate based on typical episode structure

3. **YouTube Content Scarcity:** Found limited specific YouTube analysis for Episode 123 (most results were for recent episodes like 1123)

4. **Pluton Location Controversy:** There's a significant fan debate about whether Pluton was in Alabasta or Wano, creating confusion in the lore

### Notable Fan Theories

1. **Crocodile's Trust Issues** - Theory that someone betrayed him in the past, explaining his paranoia
2. **Robin's Planning** - Theory that Robin never intended to give Crocodile the information even if the Poneglyph contained it
3. **Bomb as Excavation Tool** - Theory that Crocodile's bomb was meant to excavate Pluton from beneath Alubarna
4. **Robin's Escape Plan** - Theory that Robin identified Luffy as her escape route before being stabbed

### Voice Acting Notes
- **Japanese Cast:** Maintained from series start (Mayumi Tanaka as Luffy, Ryuzaburo Otomo as Crocodile, Yuriko Yamaguchi as Robin)
- **English Cast (Funimation):** Colleen Clinkenbeard (Luffy), John Swasey (Crocodile), Stephanie Young (Robin)

### Historical Context
- Episode aired during peak Arabasta Arc popularity in Japan (2002)
- This betrayal scene is consistently ranked as one of the best villain moments in the series
- Sets up major plot points that pay off in later arcs (Robin joining crew, Poneglyph mysteries)

- Official wikis (One Piece Wiki on Fandom)

**Reliability:**
