    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Admiral Aokiji intentionally gave Spandam the Golden Den Den Mushi knowing that Spandam's incompetence might lead to the Buster Call being triggered accidentally. This could have been part of Aokiji's conflicted feelings about the World Government's methods, especially given his complicated history with the Ohara incident and helping Robin escape. By putting such dangerous power in Spandam's incompetent hands, Aokiji may have been subtly undermining the operation.",

    "theoryText": "The mysterious hole beneath Enies Lobby suggests that the location was once struck by the Ancient Weapon Uranus, similar to what happened to Lulusia Kingdom. Many fans theorize that Enies Lobby was built on the ruins of an important ally of the Ancient Kingdom, or possibly even part of the Ancient Kingdom itself. The World Government deliberately established a judicial facility there as a symbolic conquest over the past. The Buster Call on Enies Lobby in episode 294 would then represent the World Government destroying its own symbol built on conquered land.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Joy Boy sacrificed himself protecting the location that would become Enies Lobby from an Ancient Weapon Uranus attack similar to the one used on Lulusia Kingdom. This theory suggests that the shape of the island and the eternal daylight are connected to Joy Boy's final stand. The hole beneath Enies Lobby would be the result of the weapon's partial strike. When Spandam triggers the Buster Call in episode 294, it creates an ironic parallel - the World Government destroys a location that may have been the site of Joy Boy's heroic sacrifice.",

The chaos caused by the evacuation and the incoming fleet created confusion that the Straw Hats could exploit. Additionally, the Marines attacking their own facility created a situation where CP9 couldn't get reinforcements. Without the Buster Call, the Straw Hats might have been cornered by fresh Marine forces or unable to escape the Gates of Justice.",
