    "theoryText": "The Knock-Up Stream phenomenon may have been used by ancient civilizations as a method to escape a great flood. The fact that Jaya's golden city was launched into the sky by a Knock-Up Stream suggests this natural phenomenon could have been integral to the Ancient Kingdom's history. Some theorize that similar streams might exist around the world and could become crucial during a future world-flooding event.",

    "theoryText": "The Skypiea Arc, beginning with Episode 152's journey, is theorized to be a condensed version of the entire One Piece story. The journey via the Knock-Up Stream represents the dangerous path to reaching the ultimate goal. The conflict between the Shandians and Skypieans mirrors the Ancient Kingdom vs World Government conflict. The golden city of Shandora parallels Laugh Tale. This theory suggests Oda used Skypiea to foreshadow major endgame reveals.",

    "theoryText": "Similar to how Jaya was split by the Knock-Up Stream with half remaining below and half going to the sky, some theorize that Laugh Tale (or another crucial island) experienced the same fate. This could explain why Laugh Tale is so difficult to find - part of it might be in the sky while another part remains in the Blue Sea. The Straw Hats' journey via the Knock-Up Stream in Episode 152 could be foreshadowing their eventual discovery of this split island.",

This parallels how their earlier encounter in Mock Town also didn't result in a fight.",
