    "fullText": "Fans theorize that the ancient weapon Poseidon's true purpose is not destruction but salvation. Noah was constructed during the Void Century as a massive evacuation vessel that could be pulled by Sea Kings under Poseidon's command. The 'Promised Day' that King Neptune mentions would be when Fish-Man Island faces destruction, and Poseidon (Shirahoshi) would use her powers to command the Sea Kings to pull Noah to the surface, fulfilling Joy Boy's promise to help the fish-men migrate to the surface world and live alongside humans.",

The ship, pulled by a team of Sea Kings under Poseidon's command, would serve as a devastating weapon against the World Government. A gigantic ark crewed by fish-men and pulled by sea kings sailing into battle would be as deadly a weapon as could be imagined. This theory suggests Joy Boy's promise was to help the fish-men take revenge against surface dwellers who oppressed them during the Void Century.",

    "fullText": "Following Vegapunk's revelation about a coming great flood, fans theorize that Noah's purpose is tied to this apocalyptic event. The theory suggests that when the Red Line is destroyed (possibly by the ancient weapons), the world's oceans will unite and sea levels will rise dramatically. Noah would then serve as a massive refuge ship, pulled by Sea Kings to save both fish-men and humans from drowning. This would explain why the ship is so enormous and why it's called Noah - it's literally meant to be the One Piece world's version of Noah's Ark. The destruction of the Red Line would also destroy both Mariejoa and Fish-Man Island, making evacuation necessary.",
