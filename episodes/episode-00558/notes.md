- **Manga Chapters**: 636 (page 19) and 637 (pages 2-19)

## Research Process

### Script Sources
- No full episode script/transcript was available due to copyright restrictions
- Relied on episode summaries from One Piece Wiki (Fandom)
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for accuracy

### Key Events Identified
1. Noah's descent toward Fish-Man Island
2. Luffy's demonstration of Armament Haki techniques
3. Vander Decken IX's betrayal of Hody Jones
4. Shirahoshi's selfless sacrifice decision
5. Hody Jones pursuing Noah
6. Luffy preparing to protect Shirahoshi

### Character Analysis
**Main Characters Featured:**
- Luffy (demonstrating post-timeskip power)
- Shirahoshi (character growth moment)
- Vander Decken IX (villain breakdown)
- Hody Jones (being overwhelmed)
- Neptune (exposition about Noah)

### Timestamp Estimation
Since I couldn't access the actual episode video, timestamps were estimated based on:
- Typical episode structure (opening ~1:30, recap ~2:00)
- Event pacing from episode summaries
- Standard commercial break patterns
- Timestamps should be considered approximate (+/- 30 seconds)

### Notable Techniques
**New Techniques Debuted:**
1. **Buso Koka: Gomu Gomu no Bullet** - Armament Haki-enhanced punch
2. **Atama Buso: Gomu Gomu no Kane** - Armament Haki-enhanced headbutt

**Note**: The manga version of these attacks were unnamed; the anime gave them specific names.

## External Media Found
- Limited YouTube reaction content available (most found on Bilibili and Dailymotion)
- Contemporary review from The Fandom Post (2012)
- Several recent reaction videos from content creators
- Podcast discussion covering episodes 558-560

## Fan Theory Highlights
Multiple prominent theories discovered:
1. **Evacuation Theory**: Noah as salvation vessel for Fish-Man Island migration
2. **Weapon Theory**: Noah as military weapon against World Government
3. **Luffy-Joy Boy Theory**: Luffy will fulfill ancient promise with Shirahoshi
4. **World Flood Theory**: Noah's role in post-Red Line destruction

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- Full episode transcript not publicly available
- Had to rely on wiki summaries and reviews
- Some dialogue may not be exact quotes

### Timestamp Accuracy
- Could not verify exact timestamps without video access
- Provided estimates based on episode structure
- Future researchers may want to verify with actual episode

### Voice Actor Credits
- English dub voice actors verified through multiple sources
- Some supporting character voice actors may not be complete

## Quality Considerations

### Strengths
- Comprehensive event documentation (8 major events identified)
- Multiple external media sources found and documented
- Rich fan theory content discovered
- Strong source documentation

### Limitations
- No direct episode viewing conducted
- Timestamps are approximate
- Character voice actor list may be incomplete for minor characters
- No official character images sourced (would require episode screenshots)

## Recommendations for Future Research
1. Verify timestamps with actual episode viewing
2. Add official episode screenshots to events and character moments
3. Expand voice actor credits for supporting characters
4. Search for additional YouTube content creators who may have covered this episode
5. Look for Reddit discussions from r/OnePiece around the original air date

## Notable Observations
- Episode 558 is a pivotal moment in the Fish-Man Island Arc
- Marks significant character development for Shirahoshi
- Showcases Luffy's post-timeskip strength effectively
- Noah's introduction as active threat creates arc climax
- Episode balances action (Luffy vs Hody) with world-building (Noah lore)

## Incremental Data Approach
Following the research prompt guidelines, I focused only on:
- What debuts in THIS episode (new techniques)
- What changes in THIS episode (character development, relationships)
- What events occur in THIS episode
- External media specifically about THIS episode

Did NOT attempt to:
- Build complete character profiles
- Document all previous appearances
- Create comprehensive location histories
- Track all bounty progressions

This allows the episode data to be merged with other episode research later.
