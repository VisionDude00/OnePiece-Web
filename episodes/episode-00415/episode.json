Despite his hatred for humans due to his own experiences, Fisher Tiger freed human slaves alongside fish-men and other races without discrimination.",

His actions directly saved Hancock and her sisters, and his philosophy of liberation without discrimination establishes him as a truly noble character.

To hide the slave brands on the freed slaves who joined him, he created the Sun Pirates' jolly roger - a sun symbol that he branded over the Hoof of the Celestial Dragon. This explains why Hatchan and other fish-men bear this mark, though they were never enslaved themselves (they added it to show solidarity).",

She reveals that she maintains her cold, arrogant persona to keep people at a distance and prevent them from discovering the truth.",
      "significance": "This confession shows the psychological toll of Hancock's trauma - she has built her entire public persona around hiding her past. It reveals her vulnerability and the heavy burden she has carried alone for years. It also demonstrates her deep care for her people, as she chose to be seen as arrogant rather than bring shame to the Kuja tribe.",
