# Research Notes for Episode 492

## Episode Overview
Episode 492 is a special crossover episode between One Piece and Toriko, celebrating the launch of the Toriko anime. It aired as part of a 1-hour special block (Toriko Episode 1 + One Piece Episode 492).

## Key Findings

### Special Crossover Status
- **Non-Canon**: This episode is not part of the main One Piece storyline
- **Pre-Timeskip**: The Straw Hats appear in their pre-timeskip forms, which differs from the manga crossover that featured post-timeskip versions
- **Dual Episode**: Served as both Toriko Episode 1 and One Piece Episode 492
- **No English Dub**: Funimation did not dub this episode due to lack of Toriko licensing rights

### Production Notes
- **Director**: Naoyuki Itō
- **Screenplay**: Isao Murayama
- **Air Date**: April 3, 2011 (Japan), October 18, 2014 (Crunchyroll US)
- **Theme Song**: "One day" by The ROOTLESS (used as ending instead of opening for this episode - last use of this song in the series)
- **TV Rating**: 10.8% (ranked third in time slot)

### Character Debuts (from Toriko series)
1. **Toriko** - Main protagonist of Toriko, gourmet hunter (VA: Ryōtarō Okiayu)
2. **Komatsu** - Toriko's chef companion (VA: Romi Park)
3. **Coco** - Toriko's ally, gourmet hunter (VA: Takahiro Sakurai)
4. **Sunny** - Toriko's ally, gourmet hunter
5. **Rin** - Supporting character (VA: Asami Tano)

### Location Debut
- **Hungry-La Island**: A legendary island that is actually a giant natural pudding à la mode. Ancient texts had a transcription error confusing kanji for "bird" (鳥) and "island" (島).

### New Technique
- **Gomu Gomu no Kugi Punch**: Non-canon combination attack by Luffy and Toriko

### Plot Structure
1. Straw Hats discover Hungry-La Island while low on food
2. Meet Toriko and Komatsu
3. Hunt Hungry-La Bird together
4. Nami and Komatsu kidnapped by Cocoalas
5. Rescue mission with help from Coco and Sunny
6. Battle against Knock-Out Koala
7. Island revealed to be giant dessert
8. Crews part ways

## Research Challenges

- **No Full Script**: Could not locate a complete word-for-word transcript with accurate timestamps
- **Limited English Coverage**: Due to lack of English dub, fewer English-language reviews and discussions
- **Fan Theory Absence**: No specific fan theories found for this episode, likely due to its non-canon crossover status
- **Screenshot/Image Limitations**: Could not access official screenshots or promotional images
