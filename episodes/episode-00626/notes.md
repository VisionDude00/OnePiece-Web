# Research Notes for Episode 626

## Episode Overview
Episode 626 "Caesar Goes Missing! The Pirate Alliance Makes a Sortie!" is the first episode of the anime-original Caesar Retrieval Arc. This three-episode filler arc serves as a bridge between the Punk Hazard and Dressrosa arcs.

## Key Research Findings

### Anime-Original Content
- This entire arc is filler and not present in the manga
- Only pages 14-15 of Chapter 699 are adapted in this episode
- The omitted manga content includes Sanji and Kinemon being angry about Momonosuke sleeping with Nami and Robin

### Notable Debuts
1. **Breed** - Main antagonist with the Peto Peto no Mi
2. **Peto Peto no Mi** - Anime-only Devil Fruit allowing living creature control
3. **Kung Fu Dugong's Return** - First appearance since Episode 96 (Alabasta)
4. **Sea Animal Pirates** - Anime-only crew led by the Kung Fu Dugong
5. **Shark Submerge III** - Franky's submarine debuts

### Haki Significance
The Kung Fu Dugong using Armament Haki is particularly significant:
- Second animal shown using Haki in the series (first was Alpacacino)
- Demonstrates animals can achieve Haki through willpower and training
- Anime-original but beloved by fans who wish it were canon

### Production Details
- **Air Date**: December 22, 2013 (Japan), December 21, 2013 (US simulcast)
- **Last episode of 2013**
- **Direction**: Takashi Ōtsuka
- **Screenplay**: Jin Tanaka
- **Opening**: "Hands Up!" by Kota Shinzato (Opening 16, episodes 591-628)
- **No Ending Theme**: Toei stopped airing endings from episodes 279-1070

### Interesting Trivia
1. Law's nickname inconsistency: Calls Chopper "Tanuki-ya" but SBS Volume 72 says it should be "Tony-ya"
2. Luffy's "slime human" comment accidentally foreshadows Trebol's Beta Beta no Mi
3. Breed's laughter: "Petotototo!"
4. Shark Submerge III can dive to 5,000 meters

### Fan Reception
**Positive Reviews:**
- Praised for being "short and sweet" (only 3 episodes)
- Breed considered a well-designed filler villain with logical weaknesses
- Good pacing and doesn't overstay its welcome

**Mixed/Negative Reviews:**
- Some felt the forced Luffy vs Law battle was disappointing
- CBR criticized it as "too long for its own good but not long enough to create emotional investment"
- TheGamer called it "not the most remarkable filler arc" but worth watching once for the comedy

### Research Challenges
- Limited script sources available (mostly relied on wiki summaries and episode descriptions)
- Few dedicated YouTube analysis videos found for this specific episode
- No Reddit discussion threads specifically about episode 626 found
- Most external media covers the entire 3-episode arc rather than episode 626 individually

### Connections to Canon
- SMILE fruits mentioned (connects to Doflamingo storyline)
- Caesar's importance to multiple parties established
- Transition between major arcs
- Themes of freedom vs control relevant to broader series
