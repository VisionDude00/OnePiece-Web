    "summary": "A theory that Luffy's precise control of Conqueror's Haki in episode 518 demonstrates the effectiveness of Rayleigh's two-year training regimen and foreshadows future advanced Haki applications.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Luffy's ability to use Conqueror's Haki in a controlled manner against the Fake Straw Hats demonstrates not just raw power, but precision and control that will be crucial for future battles. This controlled application is markedly different from his unconscious use at Amazon Lily and Marineford, suggesting Rayleigh's training focused heavily on Haki mastery. Some fans believe this moment foreshadows even more advanced Haki techniques like Conqueror's Haki coating that Luffy will master later.",

    "summary": "Following Caribou's introduction in episode 518, fans theorized about his potential Devil Fruit powers and his role as an antagonist in the Fish-Man Island arc.",
    "fullText": "When Caribou was first introduced in episode 518 with his impressive 210,000,000 berry bounty, fans immediately began speculating about his abilities and role. His epithet 'Wet Hair' suggested a potential Logia-type Devil Fruit related to water or swamps. Fans theorized that his high bounty and infiltration plan indicated he would be a significant threat in the upcoming arc. Additionally, some fans speculated that his knowledge gathering tendencies might make him important to larger plot points involving ancient weapons.",
