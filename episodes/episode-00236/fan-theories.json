    "theoryText": "The scene where the Going Merry appears to be crying (with water running down its hull) is not just poetic imagery, but the first clear visual evidence of the ship's klabautermann (ship spirit). This foreshadows the later revelation that the Going Merry has developed a consciousness and will appear to the crew in physical form.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the entire Luffy vs. Usopp conflict was narratively designed to test whether Luffy could truly be a captain worthy of reaching the end of the Grand Line. A true captain must be able to make difficult decisions that hurt people they care about, prioritize the crew's safety over sentimentality, and bear the weight of command. Luffy's ability to win the duel while still showing compassion (giving Usopp the ship) proved his growth.",

    "theoryText": "Usopp's refusal to let go of the Going Merry mirrors the audience's own emotional attachment to the ship. As the first major 'home' for the Straw Hats that viewers watched for over 200 episodes, letting go of the Merry was difficult for fans too. Usopp served as the in-universe representation of this attachment, making his fight with Luffy an emotional proxy for the audience's own struggle to accept change.",

This could reference his time as a bounty hunter working with or observing other pirate crews, or even his own brief consideration of what it means to be a leader of his own crew versus a loyal subordinate.",
