    "theoryText": "When Luffy sees the mark on Hancock's back in Episode 412, he mentions that he's seen it before. This is a reference to Hatchan (a fishman and former member of the Sun Pirates) who also has a sun symbol covering what may have been a slave mark. Luffy's recognition suggests he's starting to piece together the connection between slaves, the Celestial Dragons, and the marks they leave on people. This foreshadows his eventual confrontation with the World Nobles at Sabaody Archipelago.",

    "title": "Why Hancock Can't Petrify Luffy: Pure Heart Theory",
    "theoryText": "Episode 412 reveals that Luffy is completely immune to Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi powers. The theory suggests this isn't just because Luffy doesn't find her attractive, but because Luffy's heart is so pure and free of lustful desires that the Devil Fruit's petrification ability simply cannot work on him. This connects to larger themes in One Piece about pure-hearted individuals being able to overcome seemingly unbeatable powers through their genuine nature. Luffy sees people for who they are, not what they look like, making him the perfect counter to Hancock's beauty-based powers.",

    "theoryText": "The fabricated Gorgon legend that Elder Nyon explains in Episode 412 serves as more than just a cover story - it's a psychological coping mechanism for the sisters. By reframing their trauma as a 'curse from defeating a monster,' they transform themselves from victims into heroes in the eyes of their people. This theory suggests that Hancock's ruthless personality and her need to maintain this lie at all costs stems from her inability to process the trauma of slavery without this protective narrative. The lie becomes her armor against the shame and pain of her past.",

    "theoryText": "Marguerite's willingness to sacrifice herself to protect Sweet Pea and Aphelandra in Episode 412 directly parallels the values that Luffy's crew embodies. This theory suggests that Oda deliberately wrote this scene to show why Luffy becomes so enraged - he sees his own crew's values reflected in Marguerite's actions. This is why he's so determined to save her and why he refuses to accept Hancock's cruel punishment. It's not just about saving someone who helped him; it's about defending the core principle of protecting your friends that defines the Straw Hat Pirates.",

    "theoryText": "Though not explicitly mentioned in Episode 412, the mark on Hancock's back that Luffy recognizes foreshadows the reveal of the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon slave mark. Fan theories from this time speculated that Luffy's recognition came from seeing Hatchan or other Sun Pirates members, as Fisher Tiger created the Sun Pirates symbol to cover the slave marks of freed slaves. This theory predicted that the sisters were former slaves freed by Fisher Tiger, which was later confirmed in Episode 415.",
