# Episode 412: Heartless Judgment! Margaret is Turned to Stone!!

## Quick Summary
Luffy discovers Hancock's secret when he sees her back, making him a target for elimination. During his trial in the Amazon Lily arena, Marguerite nobly confesses to helping him, resulting in Hancock turning her and her two friends into stone statues. Enraged by this cruelty, Luffy defeats the execution panther Bacura with a single punch, shocking the Kuja tribe. Hancock's sisters, Sandersonia and Marigold, then reveal their Devil Fruit powers and transform into massive snake-human hybrids to personally execute Luffy.

## Key Events
1. **Luffy Sees Hancock's Back** - Accidentally discovers the mark on her back, signing his death warrant
2. **Pistol Kiss Fails** - Hancock's Mero Mero powers don't work on Luffy due to his lack of attraction
3. **Marguerite's Confession** - Bravely takes responsibility to protect her friends
4. **Three Women Petrified** - Hancock cruelly turns Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra to stone
5. **Bacura Defeated** - Luffy one-shots the execution panther in a display of raw power
6. **Gorgon Sisters Transform** - Sandersonia and Marigold reveal their snake Devil Fruits
