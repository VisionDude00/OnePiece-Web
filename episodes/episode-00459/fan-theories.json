    "summary": "The fact that Portgas D. Rouge could extend her pregnancy to 20 months through sheer willpower suggests that people with the 'Will of D' possess superhuman abilities beyond just Devil Fruits, connected to their indomitable will.",
    "fullText": "Portgas D. Rouge's ability to carry Ace for 20 months is presented as an impossible feat achieved through pure willpower. This has led many fans to theorize that the 'D' bloodline carriers possess abilities related to willpower that transcend normal human limits. Rouge's feat mirrors other incredible willpower displays by D carriers like Luffy's resistance to poison in Impel Down and his ability to survive impossible situations. Some fans believe the Will of D represents an ancient power or genetic trait that grants superhuman endurance and willpower, separate from Devil Fruit abilities. This would explain why D carriers consistently accomplish 'impossible' feats and survive situations that would kill normal humans.",

    "summary": "Some fans theorize that the World Government actually discovered Ace's identity as Roger's son much earlier than they claim, and deliberately waited to use this information at the most strategic moment to destroy Whitebeard.",
    "fullText": "The timing of Sengoku's revelation raises questions about when exactly the World Government discovered Ace's true parentage. The theory suggests that Cipher Pol may have known for years but kept it secret, waiting for the perfect opportunity to use this knowledge. By waiting until Ace was captured and Whitebeard was committed to a rescue, they could use the revelation for maximum propaganda effect while also ensuring Whitebeard would come to Marineford. This would explain why they didn't hunt Ace more aggressively as a child - they wanted him to grow up and become important to Whitebeard first, making his execution more devastating to the Yonko. The revelation's theatrical timing during the broadcast suggests it was always meant as a propaganda tool to justify the war to the world.",

    "fullText": "Given the revelation that Garp raised Ace as his grandson and promised Roger to protect him, fans have theorized that Garp may have been subtly working against the Marines' plans from within. While he couldn't openly defy orders without being executed for treason, he may have held back crucial intelligence, failed to implement certain defensive strategies, or positioned himself where he could potentially interfere if needed. His visible emotional conflict throughout the arc supports this theory. Some fans point to later events in the war where Garp's actions (or inactions) seem suspicious, suggesting he was torn between his duty and his love for Ace. This would add tragic depth to his character - trying to save Ace in small ways while maintaining his Marine facade, ultimately failing at both.",

    "summary": "Theory that Ace deliberately took his mother's surname 'Portgas' instead of 'Gol' to honor her sacrifice and reject his father's legacy, showing he always knew or suspected his true parentage.",
    "fullText": "The revelation that Ace chose to use his mother's surname Portgas instead of his father's Gol has deeper significance according to this theory. Some fans believe Ace may have learned about his true parentage earlier than the public revelation and consciously rejected the 'Gol D.' name to honor his mother's 20-month sacrifice. By calling himself 'Portgas D. Ace,' he acknowledged his mother's incredible will and sacrifice while distancing himself from Roger's legacy. This would explain his emotional rejection when people call Roger his father, insisting Whitebeard is his only father. The theory suggests Garp may have told him the truth at some point, or Ace figured it out himself, leading to his complex feelings about his heritage and his desperate need to find a father figure in Whitebeard.",
