## Episode Overview
Episode 99 "False Fortitude! Camu, Rebel Soldier at Heart!" is a filler episode that aired on February 3, 2002 in Japan. It's one of four anime-only episodes (98, 99, 101, 102) during the Alabasta Arc focusing on the crew's desert journey.

### Challenges Encountered
1. **No Full Script Available**: Could not locate a complete episode transcript. Had to rely on wiki summaries and reviews for plot details.
2. **Limited Timestamps**: Exact timestamps were not available in sources, so I estimated based on typical episode structure and event sequence.
3. **Animation Director Unknown**: Staff credits were incomplete; animation director name not found in available sources.
4. **Limited YouTube Content**: Could not find specific YouTube analysis videos for this filler episode, likely due to its skippable nature.

## Incremental Data Approach

- What debuts in this episode (Camus, Ido village)
- What key moments occur in THIS episode
- Character developments specific to THIS episode
- No attempt to build complete character profiles

## Final Notes
Episode 99 is a wholesome filler episode that explores themes central to One Piece while not advancing the main plot. Camus's transformation from fraud to hero provides an inspiring standalone story that echoes larger themes about the nature of heroism throughout the series. While skippable, it's well-crafted filler that some viewers may enjoy for its character moments and themes.
