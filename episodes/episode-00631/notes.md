## Final Notes

Episode 631 is a pivotal episode that introduces one of the most important characters in the latter half of One Piece (Admiral Fujitora) and sets up the emotional core of the Dressrosa Arc through the Mera Mera no Mi reveal. The episode successfully balances character introduction, mystery building, and emotional storytelling.

The research was comprehensive but limited by the lack of available episode transcripts. Future researchers should attempt to locate Japanese sources or fan translations for more precise dialogue quotes and scene descriptions.
