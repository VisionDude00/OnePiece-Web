    "fullText": "During the Warship Island arc, Luffy demonstrates the ability to understand Ryu the Sennenryu dragon, even though he doesn't have Apis' Devil Fruit powers that grant animal communication. This seemed like a filler inconsistency at the time, but years later in the Zou arc (episodes 750+), it's revealed that Luffy possesses the rare ability called the 'Voice of All Things,' which allows him to hear the voices of certain creatures and objects. This means the filler arc accidentally foreshadowed a major canonical ability that would become important to the story. The fact that Luffy could understand a mythical creature in the filler arc connects to his later ability to hear Zunesha, the ancient elephant carrying Zou island.",

    "summary": "The existence of dragons in the Warship Island filler arc contradicts later canon episodes where characters treat dragons as mythical creatures that don't exist.",
    "fullText": "The Warship Island arc introduces the Sennenryu (thousand-year dragons) as real creatures, with Ryu being a living example. However, this creates a major continuity error with later canonical arcs. During the Thriller Bark arc, Zoro doubts the existence of dragons. More significantly, in the Punk Hazard arc (episodes 579+), both Luffy and Zoro treat Vegapunk's artificial dragon as unprecedented and even call dragons 'fictional creatures,' despite having encountered a real dragon in the Warship Island arc. This contradiction is one of the reasons why filler arcs are considered non-canon - they can't maintain consistency with Oda's manga storyline. Some fans theorize that the Straw Hats simply forgot about Ryu, while others suggest the Sennenryu were so rare that they're still considered mythical despite the crew's encounter.",

    "fullText": "The Warship Island arc holds a unique place in One Piece filler history as the only filler arc that Eiichiro Oda is known to have publicly commented on, praising it in an early February issue of Weekly Shonen Jump. Additionally, the anime's first series director Konosuke Uda revealed that the Sennenryu plot was originally considered for use in a theatrical film. This has led some fans to theorize that while the arc isn't manga-canon, it might have 'semi-canonical' status or at least was approved by Oda in some capacity. The theory suggests that Oda may have been involved in the arc's creation more than typical filler, which could explain why elements like Luffy's ability to understand Ryu later connected to canonical abilities. However, the dragon continuity issues with Punk Hazard suggest that even with Oda's early approval, the arc wasn't designed to fit into long-term canon.",
