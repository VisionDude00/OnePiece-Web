EPISODE SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

This episode marks the critical turning point where CP9 successfully departs
Water 7 with Robin, Franky, and Usopp aboard the Puffing Tom sea train. The
Straw Hats' failure to prevent this departure creates the emotional catalyst
for the entire Enies Lobby rescue mission.

Key Moments:
• Robin boards the train without resistance despite her power
• Sanji secretly infiltrates the Puffing Tom alone
• Nami arrives too late and tearfully watches the train depart
• Luffy and Zoro are physically trapped (comedic relief)
• Chopper whispers "Please come back, Usopp!"

Thematic Focus:
• Sacrifice and selflessness (Robin's continued self-sacrifice)
• Desperation and helplessness (crew's failed attempts)
• Determination and resolve (Sanji's solo mission)

LIMITATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Limitations:
1. No full episode script available - used summaries instead
2. Timestamps are approximate estimates (±30-60 seconds)
3. Limited episode-specific YouTube content found
4. No dedicated fan theories located for this episode

Recommendations for Enhancement:
1. Verify timestamps with actual episode when available
2. Extract exact dialogue quotes from episode
3. Search YouTube directly for reaction content
4. Compare with manga chapters 360-361 for differences

(Would be 95%+ with actual episode script and video access)
