    "title": "Usopp as the Most Negative Straw Hat Theory",
    "theoryText": "Based on how the Negative Hollows affected each Straw Hat differently, fans theorize that the intensity of the ghost's effect reveals the crew's positivity levels. Since Usopp was completely immune and actually affected the ghosts, he's the most negative. Meanwhile, since Zoro was hit hard by the ghosts (as shown in previous episodes), he might actually be one of the most positive and optimistic of the Straw Hats, despite his serious demeanor.",

    "title": "Zoro-Ryuma Ancestral Connection",
    "theoryText": "The striking physical similarities between Zoro and Ryuma, combined with their identical fighting styles and the fact that Zoro was 'destined' to claim Shusui, suggest that Zoro is a direct descendant of Ryuma through the Shimotsuki family. This theory proposes that a member of the Shimotsuki family defected from Wano and gave birth to either Zoro or one of his parents in the East Blue, explaining why Zoro looks like Ryuma and has natural affinity for swordsmanship.",

    "title": "Black Blade Creation Mastery Theory",
    "theoryText": "The revelation of Shusui as a black blade sparked theories about how swords become black blades. Fans theorize that Ryuma 'became' a black blade master through perfect Haki and sword technique mastery. The theory suggests that Zoro needs to master the same combination of Haki flow and sword technique that Ryuma did to turn his own swords into black blades, particularly Enma. This is why Ryuma was called the 'Sword God' - because he achieved the ultimate level of swordsmanship.",

    "title": "Oars' Shadow Memory Inconsistency",
    "theoryText": "An observed inconsistency exists regarding shadow memories. When Lola received her shadow back from her zombie counterpart, she identified Nami as 'Namizo' (the male alias), implying that memories a shadow receives are reciprocated back to original hosts once reunited. However, this wasn't observed in any Straw Hat pirates including Luffy (who had his shadow in Oars). Fans theorize this could mean: 1) Only weaker shadows retain memories, 2) The memory transfer only works with similar body types, or 3) Luffy did receive Oars' memories but they were too fragmentary to matter.",

    "title": "Usopp vs Perona as Luffy vs Enel Parallel",
    "theoryText": "Fans have drawn parallels between Usopp's fight against Perona and Luffy's fight against Enel. In both cases, a weaker Straw Hat defeated a significantly more powerful opponent not through strength, but through an innate immunity to their most powerful ability. Just as Luffy's rubber body negated Enel's lightning, Usopp's natural negativity negated Perona's depression ghosts. This theory suggests Oda intentionally creates these 'natural enemy' matchups to show that power isn't everything - the right weakness can defeat any ability.",

This theory suggested that Zoro obtaining Shusui was temporary and would connect the Straw Hats to Wano Country in the future. The theory proved accurate when Zoro later exchanged Shusui for Enma during the Wano arc.",
