# Episode 273 Research Notes

## Episode Overview
Episode 273 "Everything Is to Protect My Friends! Second Gear Activated!" is one of the most iconic episodes in One Piece history, featuring the full combat debut of Luffy's Gear Second technique.

## Research Highlights

### Major Discoveries
1. **Gear Second Debut**: This episode showcases the first extensive use of Gear Second in combat, with Luffy demonstrating six different Jet techniques (Pistol, Rifle, Stamp, Spear, Missile, and Bazooka).

2. **Cultural Impact**: The episode has a 9.3/10 IMDB rating and 9.1% TV rating in Japan (ranked 4th among One Piece episodes at the time).

3. **Animation Quality**: The fight between Luffy and Blueno received significant animation enhancement beyond the manga source material, with extended combat sequences.

### Character Moments
- **Luffy**: Major character development showing his growth since the Aokiji defeat. His acknowledgment that his body "can't quite take Gear Second" foreshadows future development.
- **Blueno**: Serves as the benchmark for Gear Second's power, being completely outclassed despite his CP9 training.
- **Zoro**: Debuts Enbima Yonezu Oni Giri technique (name contains Japanese wordplay meaning "shrimp mayonnaise rice ball").

### Thematic Elements
The episode title emphasizes the core theme of protecting nakama (friends/crewmates), which drives the entire Enies Lobby arc. Luffy's power-up is explicitly motivated by his desire to never let his crew be hurt again.

### Technical Details
- **Opening**: Brand New World by D-51 (episodes 264-278)
- **Ending**: Adventure World by Delicatessen (episodes 264-278)
- **Manga Source**: Chapters 387-388
- **Air Date**: July 30, 2006 (Japan), July 27, 2013 (US Simulcast)

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Sources
Could not locate a complete episode script/transcript. Relied on:
- Wiki summaries and chapter adaptations
- Fan blog posts and reactions
- Video clips (though couldn't watch full episode directly)

### Timestamp Estimates
Timestamps for events are approximations based on typical episode pacing and relative placement in the narrative. Exact timestamps would require watching the actual episode.

### External Media Limitations
- Many YouTube videos were on Bilibili or region-locked
- Could not access specific Reddit threads (search unavailable at times)
- Some reaction videos lack detailed metadata (view counts, dates)

## Notable Trivia

1. **Voice Acting**: Seiji Sasaki (Blueno's Japanese VA) also voiced various Power Rangers characters in Super Sentai.

2. **Oda's Inspiration**: The "Jet" naming for Gear Second attacks was inspired by Dreams Come True's song "Jet".

3. **Historical Significance**: Episode 278 was the last to use ending themes for 17 years in the One Piece anime.

4. **Rating Success**: 9.3/10 IMDB rating makes this one of the highest-rated episodes in the series.
