    "theoryText": "Fans theorize about when exactly Luffy developed Gear Second. Some believe he conceptualized it during the sea train journey to Enies Lobby after witnessing CP9's Rokushiki techniques, particularly Soru (Shave). Others think he had been working on it since his devastating defeat by Admiral Aokiji, constantly thinking about how to become stronger to protect his crew. The technique seems to be inspired by observing how CP9 members enhance their physical abilities through Rokushiki.",

Fans note that the episode emphasizes protecting friends in its title, and Luffy's internal monologue often references not letting his crew be hurt again. Gear Second represents Luffy's first self-developed power-up specifically designed to bridge the gap between himself and admiral-level opponents.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Gear Second is only possible because of Luffy's rubber body - specifically, his rubber cardiovascular system can withstand the extreme pressure of accelerated blood flow that would kill a normal person. This theory suggests that Luffy's understanding of his Devil Fruit has evolved from simple stretching to manipulating his internal biology. The technique represents a major leap in creative Devil Fruit usage, inspiring later theories about Devil Fruit 'awakening' being tied to understanding one's power at a fundamental level.",

Fans note that Blueno even comments that Luffy's speed resembles Soru during the fight. Rather than learning Rokushiki directly, Luffy created his own method to achieve similar results using his Devil Fruit powers. This demonstrates Luffy's combat genius - he doesn't copy techniques, but understands the principles and adapts them to his unique abilities.",

The steam represents Luffy's burning passion and determination to save Robin - his willpower literally manifesting as visible heat. This theory connects to the broader One Piece theme that willpower and determination can manifest as physical phenomena (later confirmed with Haki). The pink/red coloring of Luffy's skin isn't just from blood flow, but represents his burning emotions.",
