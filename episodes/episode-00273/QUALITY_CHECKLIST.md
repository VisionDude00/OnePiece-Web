## Research Limitations & Notes

### What Worked Well
- Comprehensive wiki sources provided excellent foundation

- Multiple articles confirmed key facts
- Fan community provided rich theory content

### What Could Be Improved

- **Timestamps are estimates** - Would need actual episode viewing for exact times
- **Limited YouTube analytics** - Many videos lacked view counts and engagement data
- **Some searches unavailable** - Reddit search was intermittently unavailable
- **Animation staff incomplete** - Only director confirmed, not all key animators

### Workarounds Used
- Used manga chapters 387-388 as script equivalent
- Estimated timestamps based on typical episode pacing (24-minute runtime)
- Included available external media even without full metrics
- Documented search limitations in notes.md
