    "summary": "Some fans theorize that while the Neo Marines are non-canon, their ideology and existence may have influenced or foreshadowed later canon developments regarding former Marines who become disillusioned with the World Government.",
    "fullText": "The Z's Ambition Arc introduces the Neo Marines, a group of former Marines who became disillusioned with the World Government's justice system. While this arc is filler and non-canon, some fans have noted interesting parallels to later canon story developments, particularly regarding the SWORD organization and Marines who question the absolute justice doctrine. The concept of Marines defecting due to ideological differences with the World Government was explored in this arc years before similar themes appeared in the manga. Some theorize that Oda may have consulted on this filler arc and incorporated some of its thematic elements into the main story later.",

    "summary": "Fans have observed that Shuzo's character design and fighting style, particularly as a Longarm Tribe member who uses Rokushiki and Haki, may have served as a prototype for later antagonist designs in the canon story.",
    "fullText": "Shuzo represents several 'firsts' in the One Piece anime: the first non-canon Longarm Tribe member, the first Longarm former Marine, and the first Longarm shown using Armament Haki. His unique combat style combining his racial advantages with elite Marine training creates an interesting fighting dynamic. Some fans speculate that the anime production team may have used this filler arc as a testing ground for character concepts and fighting styles that could later be incorporated into canon material. The idea of a physically unique antagonist who uses standard Marine techniques in creative ways has appeared in various forms throughout the series.",
