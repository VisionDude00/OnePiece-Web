# Research Notes for Episode 74

## Episode Overview
Episode 74 "The Devilish Candle! Tears of Regret and Tears of Anger!" is one of the most dramatic episodes in the Little Garden arc, featuring iconic character moments and intense drama.

The Tokudai Candle Service Set represents one of the most creative and disturbing uses of a Devil Fruit power in the early series:

- Creates genuine tension and stakes for the heroes
- The wax-as-hard-as-steel concept is established clearly
