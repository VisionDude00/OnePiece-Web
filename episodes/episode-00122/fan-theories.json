    "theoryText": "The Luffy vs Crocodile fight sequence in Alabasta (three separate battles with Luffy losing the first two) serves as a narrative template that Oda would later use for Luffy vs Kaido. Both opponents are vastly more powerful than Luffy, both require multiple attempts to defeat, and both fights show Luffy's growth through adaptation rather than raw power increase. This parallel suggests Oda planned the three-round battle structure as a way to showcase how Luffy overcomes seemingly impossible odds.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans debate whether Luffy's eventual victory over Crocodile makes sense from a power-scaling perspective. Crocodile is a Warlord of the Sea with years of experience, advanced Logia abilities, and combat expertise that far exceeds rookie pirate Luffy. The theory suggests that Luffy's victory was only possible due to Crocodile's arrogance, his specific weakness to water/blood, and the narrative necessity of the protagonist winning. Some argue this sets a precedent for 'plot armor' in later arcs, while others defend it as showing that circumstances, strategy, and determination matter more than raw power levels.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 122 highlights a common fan discussion about Devil Fruit weaknesses and water. Luffy drinks and uses water without being weakened, which seems to contradict the 'Devil Fruits are weak to water' rule. The theory explains that there are two different types of water vulnerability: (1) standard Devil Fruit weakness requires submersion in standing water (sea, bath, pool) which saps energy, and (2) Crocodile's specific vulnerability to moisture which makes his sand solidify. Small amounts of water or brief contact don't trigger the standard weakness, which is why Luffy can use Water Luffy tactics. This theory helps explain seemingly inconsistent water interactions throughout the series.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 122 reveals Robin's 79 million berry bounty at age 8 and her search for the Pluton Poneglyph, raising questions about her true motivations. Some fans theorize that Robin at this point in the story is seeking historical truth but has lost hope for her own survival, explaining her willingness to work with dangerous criminals like Crocodile. The theory suggests she doesn't actually want Crocodile to obtain Pluton but is using him to access Poneglyphs she couldn't reach alone. Her later betrayal of Crocodile and joining the Straw Hats supports this theory—she was never loyal to Baroque Works, just using them as a means to an end while secretly harboring suicidal ideation due to her traumatic past.",
