    "summary": "A fan theory suggests that love sickness affecting Amazon Lily empresses may be connected to an ancient lineage, specifically Nefertari D. Lili and Joy Boy, and could be genetic to the Amazonians.",
    "fullText": "According to this theory, love sickness is not just a disease but a genetic condition tied to the ancient history of the Amazonians. The theory proposes that Nefertari D. Lili was the first character to be diagnosed with this disease and that she even founded the Kuja tribe. This would explain why only empresses of Amazon Lily seem to contract love sickness - they may carry a specific ancient bloodline. The disease's connection to Joy Boy could suggest deeper implications for the One Piece world's history and the role of the Kuja in ancient times.",

    "fullText": "Clever One Piece fans have theorized that Tritoma, the empress who ruled Amazon Lily before Hancock and died from love sickness, may have a connection to Luffy. The theory is based on several observations: Tritoma appears to share physical traits with Luffy, including black hair, and personality characteristics such as a joyful and kind nature. Some fans speculate that the man Tritoma fell in love with could be related to Luffy's family, or in more extreme versions of the theory, that Tritoma could even be Luffy's mother. The theory gains traction from the fact that Tritoma died from love sickness, suggesting she fell in love with someone she couldn't be with - potentially someone from outside Amazon Lily.",

    "summary": "A theory that Hancock's love sickness and her decision to follow Luffy serves as narrative foreshadowing that she will survive until the end of the series, as the cure for love sickness is being with one's beloved.",
    "fullText": "This theory proposes that Oda introduced the love sickness mechanic specifically to ensure Hancock's survival throughout the series. According to the established lore in episode 416, previous empresses died from love sickness because they tried to suppress their feelings and remain on Amazon Lily. However, the cure is to be with one's beloved. Since Hancock chooses to follow Luffy and help him, she has effectively cured herself. The theory suggests this narrative device guarantees that Hancock will remain alive and continue to support Luffy throughout the series, potentially even appearing in the final saga. Some versions of this theory even suggest that Hancock could be Luffy's endgame romantic partner, as her love sickness serves as a 'death sentence' if she can't be with him.",

    "fullText": "This theory examines Elder Nyon's backstory and suggests she is a former empress of Amazon Lily who contracted love sickness in the past. Unlike other empresses who died, Nyon survived by making the difficult choice to leave Amazon Lily and be with her beloved. Some versions of this theory speculate that the man Nyon loved could have been Gol D. Roger, the Pirate King, which would explain her knowledge of the outside world and her understanding of the love sickness cure. This would also explain why she is so adamant that Hancock should follow Luffy - she knows from personal experience that leaving is the only way to survive. The theory adds depth to Nyon's character and explains her wisdom about relationships and the disease.",
