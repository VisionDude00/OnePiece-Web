    "theory": "Monkey D. Dragon may be a descendant of the Shandia people, potentially from Kalgara's bloodline. Evidence includes Dragon's distinctive tattoos that closely resemble those worn by Kalgara and Wyper - unique markings not commonly seen on other One Piece characters. This would explain Dragon's fierce opposition to the World Government, as the Shandia were victims of displacement and oppression. The theory suggests Dragon's revolutionary ideology may be rooted in inherited memories of injustice against his ancestors.",

    "theory": "The Skypiea Arc, particularly the Noland-Kalgara flashback, contains crucial foreshadowing about the origin of Devil Fruits. The story mentions ancient gods (Sun God, Earth God, Rain God, Forest God) that parallel the Nika revelation and other godly powers. The theory suggests that Devil Fruits originated from Sky Islands and are connected to ancient civilizations like Shandora. The 'tree' symbolism throughout Skypiea (Tree Fever, Forest of Embodiment, trees housing souls) may hint at Devil Fruits growing from special trees.",
