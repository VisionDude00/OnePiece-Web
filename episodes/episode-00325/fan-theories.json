    "theoryText": "Despite being classified as a Logia, the Yami Yami no Mi may actually be a Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit, similar to how Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Mi was revealed to be the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika. This would explain its unique properties, such as the inability to dodge attacks by turning into an element and its special power to nullify other Devil Fruits.",

This unique property of the darkness fruit is what enables Blackbeard to possess multiple Devil Fruit powers without dying, as the Yami Yami no Mi keeps the conflicting fruit essences separated.",

The nullification ability upon contact meant that Ace, who relied heavily on his Mera Mera no Mi, was at a fundamental disadvantage. This wasn't about power levels but about a bad matchup.",
