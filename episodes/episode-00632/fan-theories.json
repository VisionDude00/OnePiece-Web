    "theoryText": "When Episode 632 first aired, many viewers theorized that despite Violet's apparent allegiance to the Donquixote Pirates, she was actually being forced to work for them against her will. Her body language, the sadness in her eyes, and her interaction with Sanji suggested she might be a prisoner rather than a willing participant in Doflamingo's schemes.",

Franky even acknowledges this possibility in the episode itself.",
