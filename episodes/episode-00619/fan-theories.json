    "title": "Monet Survived the Heart Stabbing",
    "theory": "Many fans theorize that Monet survived the heart stabbing by Caesar Clown. The theory suggests that Caesar only lightly grazed or pushed Monet's heart rather than fully stabbing it, causing her to cough up blood and pass out but not die. Building C, where Monet was located, was confirmed by Oda to be completely fine and protected from the Shinokuni gas, giving her time to recover. Additionally, snow is shown falling again in Chapter 696, potentially indicating Monet's Devil Fruit powers are still active (snow stopped falling after the stabbing in Chapter 695). Some fans point to snow rabbits appearing in ocean waves in Chapter 700 as further hints of her survival.",

    "theory": "A subset of the Monet survival theory suggests that if she survived, she could potentially join the Straw Hat Pirates as a crewmate. Proponents argue that her loyalty to Doflamingo could be broken after his eventual defeat, and her snow powers would be useful for the crew. The theory gained traction after the Punk Hazard arc but has largely been dismissed by the community due to lack of evidence and her clear antagonistic role.",
