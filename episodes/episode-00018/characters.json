When searching for buried treasure on the Island of Rare Animals, he climbed the island's steepest cliff and discovered five treasure chests at the top. However, while climbing down, he fell into an empty chest that was lying below, and his body became permanently trapped inside. His crew sailed away without him, either not noticing he was missing or not caring enough to search. For the next twenty years, he adapted to his condition, appointing himself as the island's guardian while befriending its rare animal inhabitants. His transformation from a stereotypically greedy pirate to a peaceful guardian represents significant character growth.",
