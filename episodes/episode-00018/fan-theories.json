    "theory": "The theory proposes that Roger didn't find the One Piece treasure at Laugh Tale, similar to how Gaimon found empty treasure chests on the Island of Rare Animals. This parallel explains why the Roger Pirates all laughed - not because the treasure was gone, but because it hadn't been left there yet. The empty chests and Roger's laughter suggest that the One Piece is something more conceptual than physical treasure, possibly information or a revelation that can only be understood by those who complete the journey.",

    "theory": "Gaimon dedicated his life to protecting a treasure he wasn't even sure existed, and in a sense, he himself was the treasure - it was all in his head. This potentially represents the titular One Piece treasure itself. The theory suggests that the famous treasure on Laugh Tale will be something more akin to information or a concept rather than physical gold or gems. Gaimon's realization that his animal friends were his true treasure mirrors what the Straw Hats might discover at the end of their journey - that the real treasure was the friendships and experiences gained along the way.",

    "theory": "One theory speculates that the mythical Zoan Devil Fruits were originally in the six chests on Gaimon's Island of Rare Animals (five at the top plus the one Gaimon fell into), which would explain why the island has so many strange hybrid animals. The theory further suggests that Gaimon was part of the Rocks Pirates crew who got trapped on the island while the rest of the Rocks crew went to God Valley. This would explain why Gaimon's captain's face was deliberately hidden in the flashback and connects to larger mysteries about God Valley and the Rocks Pirates.",

Some fans speculate this could be connected to a major character reveal, though no consensus exists on who the captain might be. The mystery remains unsolved and is one of the earliest unresolved questions in One Piece.",
