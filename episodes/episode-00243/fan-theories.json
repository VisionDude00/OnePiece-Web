    "title": "CP9 Used Their Real Names During Undercover Mission",
    "theory": "Despite being on a top-secret five-year undercover mission, the CP9 agents infiltrating Water 7 used their actual real names - Rob Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, and Blueno. This is particularly strange for Rob Lucci, whose name was already infamous in the One Piece world for killing 500 soldiers of a kingdom at age 13. The theory questions why no one at Galley-La Company, including the well-connected Iceburg, ever suspected or recognized that 'Rob Lucci the shipwright' might be the same Rob Lucci who was notorious for that massacre. This raises questions about CP9's infiltration methods and whether they were overconfident, whether the World Government had suppressed information about Lucci's appearance, or whether Oda hadn't fully planned out Lucci's backstory when creating the Water 7 arc.",

    "title": "Oda Originally Didn't Plan for Lucci to be CP9",
    "theory": "According to statements from Eiichiro Oda, Rob Lucci was not originally intended to be part of CP9 during the early development of the Water 7 Saga. The theory suggests that Lucci may have been planned as just a regular, skilled shipwright before Oda evolved the story to make him the primary antagonist of the arc. This would explain some of the seeming plot holes around his identity and why his character seemed so naturally integrated into the Galley-La Company before the reveal. The theory explores how Oda's evolving story planning may have led to the shocking betrayal being even more effective because Lucci was genuinely written as a normal character before being reimagined as the villain.",
