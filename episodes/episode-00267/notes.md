### ID Conventions
- Used kebab-case consistently
- Character IDs match wiki naming conventions
- Event IDs follow ep267-event-### pattern

### Incremental Approach
- Focused only on what's NEW in this episode
- Character entries contain only episode 267 appearances
- No attempt to build complete profiles

## Additional Observations

1. **Three-Person Character**: Baskerville is a unique concept in One Piece - three individuals working as one. This is well-documented in the character data.

2. **Visual Spectacle**: The flying Rocketman is one of the most memorable visual moments of the arc, representing the unstoppable momentum of the rescue mission.

3. **Pacing**: This episode balances action (Luffy fighting Marines, Rocketman flight) with plot progression (Robin/Franky before Spandam).

4. **Opening/Ending**: Both "Brand New World" and "Adventure World" span only episodes 264-278, making them among the shortest-running themes in the series.

5. **Trivia**: The episode contains multiple Easter eggs referencing earlier arcs (Mr. 3 callbacks).

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. Locate episode transcript for exact dialogue and timestamps
2. Search for fan reactions and reviews from 2006-2007 when episode aired
3. Find YouTube analysis videos when search becomes available
4. Cross-reference with manga chapters 379-380 for differences
5. Look for behind-the-scenes production information

## Sources Reliability

All primary sources are from the One Piece Wiki (Fandom), which has HIGH reliability for:
- Episode metadata

## Conclusion

Episode 267 has been thoroughly researched within the constraints of available sources. The data captured focuses on incremental contributions (debuts, new techniques, key moments) and follows the established data structure. The episode marks an important turning point in the Enies Lobby arc with the spectacular Rocketman flight sequence and introduction of new antagonists.
