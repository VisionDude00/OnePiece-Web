    "theoryTitle": "Nami's Victory Was Too Easy",
    "theoryText": "Some fans argue that Nami's victory over Kalifa, who was superior to her in almost every physical aspect (speed, strength, durability), was unrealistic. They point out that unlike her fight with Miss Doublefinger which involved strategy and luck, against Kalifa 'Nami pulls a bunch of stuff she never did before in order to win.' However, defenders of the fight note that 'the mirages and lightning were good and made sense' given Nami's weather expertise.",

    "theoryTitle": "Intelligence Over Raw Power Theme",
    "theoryText": "This theory suggests that Oda intentionally made Nami weaker than Kalifa in terms of raw physical abilities to reinforce a key One Piece theme: intelligence and adaptability can overcome brute strength. Fans note that 'Nami is just smarter' than Kalifa and that her understanding of weather patterns allowed her to exploit a fundamental weakness in Kalifa's Devil Fruit. The theory argues that Oda subverted the typical Nami fight pattern where she struggles but gets lucky - here, she methodically figured out the counter-strategy.",

    "theoryTitle": "Mirage Tempo Foreshadows Advanced Observation Haki",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Nami's Mirage Tempo technique, which creates multiple illusions that move in perfect unison, foreshadows concepts that would later be explored with advanced Observation Haki. The ability to confuse opponents about which version is real parallels techniques used by characters with advanced Haki abilities in later arcs. This theory suggests Oda was planting seeds for future power systems through Nami's meteorological abilities.",
