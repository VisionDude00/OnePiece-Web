    "theoryText": "Some fans theorized that the placement of the Luffy/Ace brotherhood flashback in Episode 493 (after Ace's death) was a deliberate storytelling choice. They suggest it would have made more sense to air these origin episodes leading up to Ace's death to maximize emotional impact. However, others counter that Oda included this flashback because there won't be many opportunities to reveal Ace's backstory now that he's dead, and it serves to lighten the tone in a bittersweet way, allowing fans and Luffy to process grief by revisiting happier memories.",

    "theoryTitle": "Why Ace Was So Hostile to Luffy Initially",
    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized that Ace's extreme hostility toward Luffy in their first meeting, including leading him through deadly obstacles for three months, stems from deeper psychological issues related to his parentage and fear of forming attachments. Some suggest Ace didn't want to care about anyone because he feared they would reject him if they knew he was Gol D. Roger's son, or that he was testing whether Luffy had the strength and determination to survive in a cruel world.",
