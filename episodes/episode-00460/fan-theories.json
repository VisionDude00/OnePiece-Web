    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Portgas D. Rouge's ability to hold her pregnancy for twenty months was connected to her having the Will of D, which granted her extraordinary willpower beyond normal human capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Fans have speculated that Rouge's incredible feat of extending her pregnancy for twenty months wasn't just 'willpower' in a general sense, but specifically connected to her being a member of the D clan. The Will of D has been shown throughout the series to grant individuals exceptional determination and the ability to accomplish seemingly impossible feats. Rouge's sacrifice and her smile at death (similar to Roger's smile at his execution) suggest she possessed the same indomitable spirit characteristic of D clan members. This theory proposes that only someone with the Will of D could have accomplished such a biological impossibility.",

    "summary": "A theory suggests that Rouge may have possessed a Devil Fruit ability that allowed her to control her body's biological processes, enabling the twenty-month pregnancy rather than it being pure willpower.",
    "fullText": "Some fans have proposed that the explanation of 'sheer willpower' for Rouge's twenty-month pregnancy is too vague, and that she may have actually possessed a Devil Fruit ability that allowed her to manipulate her body's biological functions. One specific theory suggests she could have been a previous user of the Gomu Gomu no Mi (which would later be eaten by Luffy), as the rubber properties might have allowed her to 'stretch' the pregnancy duration. Others propose a different, unknown Devil Fruit with time-manipulation or biological control abilities. This theory attempts to provide a more 'logical' explanation within the One Piece universe's power system.",

    "summary": "A fan analysis suggests that Portgas D. Rouge's feat of holding her pregnancy for twenty months makes her one of the strongest-willed characters in the entire series, potentially even stronger than many fighters.",
    "fullText": "Some fans argue that Portgas D. Rouge should be considered one of the strongest characters in One Piece, not in terms of combat ability, but in terms of pure willpower and determination. The ability to biologically extend a pregnancy by ten months beyond the normal human gestation period, while knowing it would result in her death, demonstrates a level of mental fortitude that rivals or exceeds even the series' most powerful warriors. This theory suggests that 'strength' in One Piece isn't just about physical power or Devil Fruit abilities, but about the strength of one's will - and by that metric, Rouge's sacrifice represents one of the greatest displays of strength in the series. The fact that she accomplished this feat without Haki training or any known Devil Fruit ability makes it even more impressive.",

    "fullText": "Many fans believe that Edward Newgate (Whitebeard) knew or strongly suspected that Ace was Gol D. Roger's son from their first meeting. Evidence includes: Whitebeard's lack of surprise when Ace's parentage was revealed, his immediate acceptance and protection of Ace, and his attempts to get Ace to respect Roger as his father. The theory suggests that Whitebeard, having been Roger's greatest rival and someone who knew him well, would have recognized signs or characteristics in Ace that connected him to Roger. Rather than seeing Ace's bloodline as a threat or an inconvenience, Whitebeard chose to protect and love Roger's son, showing that his rivalry with Roger was built on mutual respect rather than hatred. This theory adds depth to Whitebeard's decision to go to war to save Ace - he wasn't just saving one of his 'sons,' but also honoring his old rival by protecting his legacy.",
