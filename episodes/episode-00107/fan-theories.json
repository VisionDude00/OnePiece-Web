    "summary": "A theory that Pluton was hidden beneath Arabasta in an underground river, with the naming being a deliberate hint from Oda.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized about the exact location of Pluton in Arabasta. The ancient weapon was named after the Roman deity 'Pluto' who was the ruler of the underworld. Oda purposely named the ancient weapon after the ruler of the underworld to hint at its location: underworld = underground, meaning it's beneath Alabasta. The theory suggests Pluton was lying on an underground river beneath Alabasta, which is supported by evidence of Crocodile's quicksand abilities and his statements about underground rivers in the desert. This would explain why Crocodile was so fixated on Arabasta specifically and needed the Poneglyph to find the exact location.",

    "title": "Operation Utopia's True Scale",
    "summary": "A theory that Operation Utopia was designed not just to take over Arabasta, but as a prototype for Crocodile to overthrow the World Government itself.",
    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that Operation Utopia wasn't just about taking over one kingdom - it was a test run for something much larger. With Pluton and the experience of toppling a World Government-affiliated nation, Crocodile could have expanded his operations to challenge the World Government itself. The meticulous planning, the use of a criminal organization with codenames, the manipulation of entire populations through misinformation - all of these tactics could scale up to a global level. This would explain why Crocodile was willing to invest so many years into this single operation: he was perfecting a methodology that could be repeated.",
