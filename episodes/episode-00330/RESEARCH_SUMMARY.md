## Canon Status
**FILLER ARC** - The entire Ice Hunter Arc (episodes 326-335) is anime-original content and does not appear in the manga. This episode can be skipped without missing any canon story progression.

## Recommendation
Episode 330 is a mid-arc filler episode featuring:
- Multiple simultaneous battles with Accino Family members
- Character development for Luffy (emotional connection to flag)
- Robin/Lil relationship building
- Franky's first eyecatcher (production milestone)
- Comedic Zoro moment

Most fans skip this arc, but completionists may enjoy the crew dynamics and Thousand Sunny showcase.
