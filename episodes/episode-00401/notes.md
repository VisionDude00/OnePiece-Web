## Key Findings

2. **Hawkins vs. Kizaru**: Showcases Basil Hawkins' unique fortune-telling and damage redirection abilities
3. **Multiple Pacifista Battles**: Urouge, X Drake, Kid, Law, and the Straw Hats all face Pacifista units
4. **Sentomaru Teased**: End of episode shows mysterious figure with giant broadaxe

- **Hawkins**: Damage redirection via straw voodoo dolls, fortune-telling with tarot cards
- **Urouge**: Muscle expansion ability (converts damage to size/strength)

## Research Challenges & Blockers

### Script Access
**Blocker**: No complete episode script or transcript found for Episode 401.
- Searched multiple transcript databases (Forever Dreaming, TvT, etc.)
- Found references to other episodes but not 401 specifically
- Had to rely on wiki summaries, blog posts, and video descriptions instead
- **Impact**: Event timestamps are approximated based on typical episode pacing rather than exact script timing

### Limited Podcast/Long-form Analysis
**Finding**: Very limited dedicated podcast or long-form video essay content specifically about Episode 401
- Found reaction videos on Bilibili but not traditional analysis/review podcasts
- No specific episodes from major One Piece podcasts (Totally Not Mark, Grand Line Review) focused on Episode 401
- **Impact**: External media section has fewer podcast entries than desired

### Voice Actor Information
**Partial Information**:
- Japanese voice actors well-documented for main characters
- English dub voice actors less complete for supporting characters (Hawkins, Urouge, X Drake, Sentomaru)
- **Note**: Unshō Ishizuka (Kizaru's original voice) passed away in 2018; Ryōtarō Okiayu took over the role

### Ending Theme
**Confirmed**: Episode 401 has NO ending theme
- One Piece discontinued ending themes from Episode 279 onwards
- Opening themes were extended from 110 to 150 seconds to compensate
- Ending themes didn't resume until Episode 1071 (over a decade later)

## Notable Production Details

### TV Ratings
- Episode achieved 10.6% TV rating in Japan (ranked 4th in time slot)
- Next episode preview was shortened from standard length

### Animation Credits
- **Director**: Yutaka Nakashima
- **Screenplay**: Jin Tanaka
- **Art Director**: Ryūji Yoshiike
- **Animation**: Katsumi Ishizuka

### Manga Differences
- Character "Faust" appears in Chapters 507-508 but was omitted from Episode 401
- Episode combines portions of two chapters (507 pages 13-19, 508 pages 2-19)

## Fan Theory Highlights

### Kizaru as Secret Ally Theory
- Popular fan theory compares Kizaru to Itachi from Naruto
- Evidence includes: didn't kill Straw Hats when he could have, didn't stop Kuma from saving them, avoided seriously harming Luffy at Marineford
- Theory has MODERATE popularity but LOW-TO-MODERATE plausibility
- Interesting character analysis angle but lacks concrete evidence

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

Episode 401 research successfully completed with comprehensive coverage of:

- Character debuts and developments (5 characters featured)
- Devil Fruit abilities (2 fruits with detailed power descriptions)
