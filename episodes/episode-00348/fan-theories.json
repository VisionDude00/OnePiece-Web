    "theoryText": "When Tararan and the Spider Mice recognize Brook as 'Humming Brook' from five years ago, it suggests that Brook's shadow was stolen during that visit and placed into the legendary samurai Ryuma's corpse. This would explain why Ryuma displays such exceptional swordsmanship - he has Brook's shadow, which contains the skills and personality of a master swordsman from the Rumbar Pirates.",

    "theoryText": "Gecko Moria's statement about using Luffy's strength to become Pirate King serves as a dark mirror to Luffy's own journey. The theory suggests that this moment is meant to contrast two approaches to achieving the Pirate King dream: Moria's lazy reliance on others' power through his Kage Kage no Mi versus Luffy's approach of personal growth and genuine crew bonds. This thematic contrast becomes increasingly important as the series progresses, especially regarding concepts of inherited will and true strength.",

    "theoryText": "The revelation that Brook visited Thriller Bark five years ago explains his extensive knowledge about the island's layout and Moria's operations. Some fans theorize that during his previous visit, Brook may have learned crucial information about weaknesses in Moria's zombie system or the island's structure that will later help the Straw Hats escape. His recognition by Tararan and the Spider Mice suggests he made quite an impact during that visit, possibly disrupting Moria's operations significantly.",
