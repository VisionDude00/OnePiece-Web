    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Zoro didn't train with Mihawk for the full two years. Instead, after initial instruction, Mihawk may have taken Zoro to other swordsmen on the Grand Line to train and fight, or simply made Zoro aware of Haki's existence and left him to train with the humandrills.",

The '3D2Y' message (crossing out '3 Days' to mean '2 Years') would inform the scattered crew to train for two years before reuniting, rather than the original three-day reunion plan.",

    "theoryText": "A theory suggests that the humandrills, not Mihawk, were Zoro's primary training partners during the timeskip. Their ability to copy fighting techniques meant Zoro was essentially fighting against himself and learning to overcome his own weaknesses. Mihawk simply provided the initial Haki instruction and left Zoro to develop through combat with these mimicry creatures.",
