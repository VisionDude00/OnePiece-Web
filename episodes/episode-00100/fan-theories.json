    "title": "Koza and Vivi Romantic Future Theory",
    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Koza and Vivi's childhood friendship, shown in detail in Episode 100, is laying the groundwork for a future romantic relationship. The theory suggests that after the Alabasta conflict is resolved, Koza and Vivi may develop romantic feelings, with some fans proposing Koza could eventually become Vivi's consort when she becomes queen. The theory points to their deep emotional bond, Koza's willingness to sacrifice for her, and the parallel narrative structure where childhood friends often become romantic partners in fiction.",

    "title": "Koza's Scar as Symbolic Foreshadowing",
    "theory": "Episode 100 reveals how Koza got his distinctive scar protecting Vivi from kidnappers. Some fans theorize that this scar is symbolic foreshadowing - just as Koza was scarred protecting Vivi from external enemies as a child, he would later be 'scarred' again (metaphorically) when manipulated by Crocodile into fighting against her kingdom. The theory suggests the scar represents both his protective nature and his capacity to be wounded by those he's trying to protect, making it a tragic symbol of his character arc throughout Alabasta.",

    "title": "Sand-Sand Clan as Microcosm of Alabasta",
    "theory": "Episode 100's Sand-Sand Clan represents a microcosm of Alabasta society and foreshadows the larger conflict. The theory proposes that the clan shows how nobles (Vivi) and commoners (Koza and others) can work together harmoniously when they treat each other as equals. However, the clan's eventual disbanding when Koza left for Yuba parallels how the kingdom would later be divided by the rebellion. Just as external threats (kidnappers) tried to harm their group and succeeded in separating them, external manipulation (Crocodile) would later divide the kingdom. The theory suggests Oda was showing in miniature what would happen to Alabasta on a larger scale.",
