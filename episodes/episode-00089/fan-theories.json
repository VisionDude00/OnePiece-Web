    "title": "Dr. Hiriluk was Rocks D. Xebec",
    "theory": "A fan theory proposes that Dr. Hiriluk was actually Rocks D. Xebec, the infamous pirate captain who was defeated at God Valley. The theory connects timeline elements: Hiriluk had his life-changing experience 38 years before his death, and he worked on his miracle medicine for 30 years starting 8 years after the God Valley incident. This would explain how Kureha knew about the Will of D, and would create a dramatic irony where Chopper (who has the lowest bounty) is connected to one of the most dangerous men to have ever existed.",

    "theory": "This theory suggests that the island where Hiriluk witnessed the miracle cherry blossoms that cured him was God Valley in the West Blue. The timing aligns: Hiriluk started his research on replicating the miracle 1 year after God Valley was wiped off the map. The theory proposes that an act of liberation at God Valley is what the cherry blossoms represent - something that 'cleansed even his soul.' This would connect the Drum Island arc's themes of liberation and healing to the larger mysteries of the One Piece world.",

Fans theorize that this material has a deeper connection to the World Government and Dr. Vegapunk. The theory suggests that Vegapunk's SSG (Special Science Group) incorporates Wapometal in their creations, making Wapol's defeat in the Drum Island arc inadvertently crucial to future world events. This connects a seemingly minor villain to major plot developments in the Final Saga.",

    "theory": "Episode 89's focus on Luffy protecting Dr. Hiriluk's flag is theorized to be an early example of One Piece's central theme of inherited will. Fans suggest that just as Luffy protects Hiriluk's flag (representing his medical ideals), he will later protect the dreams and wills of many others throughout the series. The theory posits that this moment in Episode 89 establishes a pattern: Luffy doesn't just defeat villains, he preserves and honors the dreams of those who came before, which will become crucial in understanding the Will of D and the series' endgame.",
