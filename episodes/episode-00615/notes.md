### Research Challenges
1. **Limited Script Access**: Could not find a complete episode script/transcript for detailed timestamp verification. Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions.
2. **Limited Reddit Discussions**: Could not locate specific Reddit discussion threads from 2013 for this episode. Episode discussions may not have been systematically posted at that time.
3. **Limited YouTube Content**: Found minimal YouTube analysis content specifically focused on episode 615. Most coverage includes it as part of multi-episode reactions (615-617).

### Notable Connections
- This episode sets up major storylines that extend through:
  - Dressrosa Arc (episodes 625-746): Doflamingo's operations
  - Zou Arc (episodes 751-779): Connecting to Kaido
  - Wano Country Arc (episodes 890+): SMILE's effects on Wano citizens

### SMILE Significance
The reveal of SMILE in this episode has far-reaching consequences:
- Explains Kaido's army of Gifters
- Connects to the suffering of Wano citizens (SMILE's 90% failure rate)
- Establishes artificial Devil Fruit technology as a key world element
- Links Doflamingo's underworld operations to the Four Emperors

### Thematic Elements
1. **Betrayal and Trust**: Caesar's betrayal of Brownbeard represents the dangers of blind loyalty
2. **Justice vs Power**: Luffy's intervention shows heroism regardless of past allegiances
3. **Corruption**: Vergo's cover-up exposes Marine corruption at high levels
4. **Scientific Ethics**: Caesar's experiments raise questions about research without ethics

### External Media Findings
- Most reaction and analysis content covers episodes 615-617 together, focusing on the Law vs Vergo fight
- Limited episode-specific content suggests episode 615 is typically viewed as part of a larger narrative arc rather than a standalone episode
- "Never Watched One Piece" Tumblr blog provided good coverage of episodes 615-616
- Crunchyroll simulcast was released one day before Japanese broadcast (October 5 vs October 6 due to time zones)

### Fan Theory Status
Several theories that emerged after this episode's revelations:
1. **Kaido's Zoan Army**: CONFIRMED - Kaido does build an army using SMILE fruits
2. **World Government Conspiracy**: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED - Government involvement more complex than initially theorized
3. **SAD Lineage Factor**: CONFIRMED - Later confirmed that Devil Fruits involve lineage factors
4. **Doflamingo Playing Both Sides**: CONFIRMED - Accurately predicted his role as underworld broker with government protection
