## Research Process

### Sources Used
1. **One Piece Wiki (Fandom)** - Primary source for episode information, character details, and production credits
2. **Forever Dreaming Transcripts** - Used for dialogue and scene descriptions
3. **Crunchyroll** - Verified as official streaming source
4. **Wikipedia** - Season and arc information
5. **Behind The Voice Actors** - Voice actor verification
6. **IMDb** - Episode rating and basic information
7. **The Fandom Post** - Contemporary review from 2013
8. **Various fan blogs and discussions** - For context and reception

### Key Discoveries

#### Major Events
1. **NHC10 Drug Discovery** - Central plot point where Chopper discovers the children have been deliberately addicted to a stimulant drug
2. **Yeti Cool Brothers Introduction** - First appearance of Rock and Scotch as antagonists
3. **Zoro, Sanji, Brook Defeat** - Cliffhanger showing three strong fighters unconscious
4. **Law Gives Smoker's Heart to Caesar** - Major strategic development

#### Character Debuts
- Rock (Yeti Cool Brothers)
- Scotch (Yeti Cool Brothers)

#### Technique Debuts
- Bakusui Boshi (Usopp's Sleeping Star)

#### Item Debuts
- NHC10 (addictive stimulant drug)

#### Location Debuts
- Punk Hazard Cave (temporary shelter for Straw Hats and children)

### Timestamp Estimation
**Note:** Exact timestamps were estimated based on typical One Piece episode structure and scene pacing, as I did not have access to watch the full episode with a timer. Timestamps should be considered approximate (±1-2 minutes).

Episode structure assumed:
- Opening: ~0:00-2:30
- Recap: ~2:30-3:00
- Main content: ~3:00-23:00
- Preview: ~23:00-24:00

Events were distributed across this timeline based on plot progression described in sources.

## Challenges and Limitations

### 1. Limited Script Access
- Could not find a complete, line-by-line transcript with exact timestamps
- Had to rely on episode summaries and partial transcripts from Forever Dreaming
- Dialogue quotes are accurate based on sources but context timing is estimated

### 2. No Full Episode Viewing
- Did not watch the complete episode, relied on written sources
- Timestamps are estimated rather than precisely measured
- Some visual details may be missed

### 3. Fan Theories
- **No specific fan theories found** for Episode 591 itself
- General Punk Hazard arc theories exist but none specifically tied to this episode
- Reddit searches did not yield episode-specific theory discussions
- This may be because Episode 591 is a mid-arc episode without major revelations that would spark standalone theories

### 4. Limited External Media
- Few YouTube reaction videos found from the original 2013 air date
- Most reactions are from more recent "first-time watchers"
- No podcast episodes found specifically discussing Episode 591
- Most available content is written reviews and wiki entries

### 5. Voice Actor Information
- Complete cast list for this specific episode not fully available
- Used standard voice actors for main characters
- Some minor characters (the children) may not have complete voice actor credits

## Data Quality Notes

### Confidence Levels

#### HIGH CONFIDENCE:
- Basic episode information (title, air date, episode number)
- Main plot events (NHC10 discovery, Yeti Cool Brothers introduction)
- Character debuts (Rock, Scotch)
- Technique debut (Bakusui Boshi)
- Manga source (Chapter 665)
- Opening theme (Hands Up! by Kōta Shinzato)
- Production credits (Screenplay, Direction, Animation)

#### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- Exact event timestamps (estimated, not measured)
- Complete dialogue quotes (based on sources, not direct viewing)
- Some character interactions and specific scene details
- Episode pacing and scene duration

#### LOW CONFIDENCE:
- Exact number and names of all children who appear in scenes
- Some minor visual details not described in sources
- Precise animation quality assessment (marked as STANDARD based on typical Punk Hazard arc quality)

## Important Observations

### Thematic Significance
This episode is particularly dark for One Piece, dealing with:
- Child endangerment and exploitation
- Drug addiction (rare topic for the series)
- Medical ethics
- Chopper's character development as a doctor

The episode title emphasizes Chopper's emotional response ("Fury"), highlighting the moral weight of Caesar's crimes.

### NHC10 Naming
**Important Note:** "NHC10" is an anime-original designation. The manga refers to the drug as a powerful stimulant but doesn't provide the specific name. This is documented in trivia and item notes.

### Animation and Pacing
Based on the Fandom Post review from 2013, the episode received criticism for slow pacing - a common complaint about the Punk Hazard arc. The review noted that the content "didn't warrant an entire episode spent on it."

### No Ending Theme
Episode 591 falls within the period (episodes 279-1070) when Toei Animation did not air ending themes. This was confirmed through multiple sources.

## Questions for Review

1. **Timestamps:** Should someone with access to the episode verify the exact timestamps for all events?

2. **Children's Names:** Are all seven children named correctly? Sources mention Sind, Mocha, Doran, Uzu, Konbu, Biyo, and Ally - should their individual roles in this specific episode be expanded?

3. **Yeti Cool Brothers Visual:** The brothers are introduced but not fully shown in this episode. Should their character entries note they're only mentioned/partially shown?

4. **Law's Motivation:** Should more context be added about Law's apparent displeasure when giving Smoker's heart to Caesar? This hints at his true intentions but isn't explicitly stated in this episode.

5. **Kin'emon's Torso:** Should there be an entry about Kin'emon as a related character, even though only his missing torso is referenced?

1. **Episode Viewing:** If possible, watch the full episode to verify timestamps and catch any visual details missed in text sources.

2. **Cross-Reference:** Compare this episode's data with Episodes 590 and 592 to ensure continuity in setup/payoff relationships.

3. **Character Expansion:** If the giant children appear in future episodes, their profiles may need expansion with additional backstory.

4. **Fan Theory Search:** Consider searching for theories about:
   - Caesar Clown's experiments
   - The Yeti Cool Brothers' identity
   - Law's true intentions
   These broader topics might reference Episode 591 even if not specifically about it.

5. **Voice Actors:** Verify voice actors for the giant children and Yeti Cool Brothers if additional credits become available.
