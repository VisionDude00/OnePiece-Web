    "theory": "The ringing of the Golden Bell in Episode 192 serves as a small-scale foreshadowing of Luffy's ultimate goal. Just as the bell's ring proved the truth that was buried for 400 years and brought peace to warring factions, Luffy's eventual discovery of the One Piece will reveal buried truths about the world and bring lasting change. The arc establishes Luffy's role not just as a fighter, but as someone who uncovers and proclaims hidden truths.",

    "theory": "The extremely rare moment in Episode 192 where Luffy's inner thoughts are heard is significant because it reveals that despite his carefree exterior, Luffy deeply feels the pain and suffering of others. This moment was necessary to show viewers that Luffy's fight against Enel wasn't just about adventure or challenge, but genuine empathy for the people of Skypiea. The rarity of this narrative technique emphasizes how special this moment was - Luffy doesn't think in words often because he acts on pure emotion and instinct.",

    "theory": "While not fully revealed in Episode 192, the Golden Bell contains important historical messages that connect to the broader mystery of the Poneglyphs and the Void Century. The fact that Gold Roger left a message on the bell suggests it's part of a larger network of historical markers. The ringing of the bell in this episode could symbolically represent the awakening or revelation of these ancient secrets.",
