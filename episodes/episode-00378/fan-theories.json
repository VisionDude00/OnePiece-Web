    "theoryText": "The One Piece treasure might actually be an afro, which would explain why the Roger Pirates laughed upon seeing it. Brook cares deeply for his afro to stay intact so Laboon would recognize him even as a skeleton. This could parallel Joyboy's thinking - by hiding the afro as the main treasure, the whale under Long Ring Long Land would recognize the person who claimed it as Joyboy's reincarnation, just as Laboon recognizes Brook by his hairstyle.",

    "theoryText": "Brook exists in a quantum superposition of being both dead and alive simultaneously, much like Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. He died and his soul returned to his body thanks to the Yomi Yomi no Mi, but by the time it found his body, only his skeleton remained. This raises the philosophical question: Is Brook truly alive, or is he technically dead but animated? The theory suggests Brook represents a unique state in the One Piece world that defies normal categorization.",

Knowing he had eaten the Yomi Yomi no Mi and would be revived, Brook promised his crewmates that he would take the Dial and play it for Laboon to hear. This Tone Dial recording becomes the physical manifestation of the crew's promise - not just Brook's voice, but the voices of all his fallen comrades singing together one last time for their beloved whale friend.",
