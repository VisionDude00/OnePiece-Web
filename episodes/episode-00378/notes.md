## Questions for Review

1. **Timestamps:** Should timestamps be verified against actual episode playback?
2. **Quotes:** Are paraphrased quotes acceptable, or should exact dialogue be sourced?
3. **Minor Characters:** Should all visible Rumbar Pirates members be documented, or just named ones?
4. **Devil Fruits File:** Should an empty devil-fruits.json be created, or omitted if no fruits debut?
5. **Engagement Metrics:** Should external media without available metrics still be included?

## Recommendations

### For Future Episodes
1. If possible, access to actual episode video would improve timestamp accuracy
2. Official scripts/transcripts would enhance quote accuracy
3. Consider adding animation analysis fields for sakuga moments
4. Track opening/ending theme transitions more systematically

### For This Episode
1. Verify timestamps against actual episode when possible
2. Confirm exact dialogue for key quotes
3. Consider adding more Rumbar Pirates members if they appear in flashback
4. Look for additional fan theories in One Piece subreddit archives

## Summary

Episode 378 is a pivotal transitional episode that balances celebration with revelation. It serves as both a conclusion to the Thriller Bark battle and a beginning of Brook's backstory arc. The episode masterfully weaves together:

1. **Recent past** (Zoro's sacrifice in Episode 377)
2. **Distant past** (Rumbar Pirates 50 years ago)
3. **Present moment** (Celebration and revelation)
4. **Future implications** (Ace's capture → Marineford)

The research was comprehensive and well-sourced, though timestamps remain the primary area where verification against the actual episode would improve accuracy. All required files have been created following the incremental data model specified in the research guidelines.

**Status:** Research Complete ✅
**Files Created:** 9/9 (including this notes.md)
**Quality:** High (with noted limitations on timestamp precision)
