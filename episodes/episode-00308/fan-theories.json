    "theoryTitle": "Did Luffy Always Know Sogeking Was Usopp?",
    "theoryText": "A popular fan debate centers on whether Luffy knew that Sogeking was actually Usopp all along, or if he genuinely believed they were separate people. Episode 308's moment where Luffy recognizes Usopp after he removes his mask is analyzed by fans as evidence for both sides. Some argue that Luffy's reaction suggests he knew all along but played along out of respect for Usopp's pride, while others believe Luffy genuinely didn't make the connection until this moment. The ambiguity of Luffy's recognition adds depth to their relationship and the emotional weight of this scene.",

    "theoryTitle": "The Symbolic Meaning of Usopp Removing His Mask",
    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Usopp's removal of his Sogeking mask in episode 308 represents more than just revealing his identity - it symbolizes Usopp letting go of his pride and the emotional barriers he erected after leaving the crew in Water 7. The mask allowed him to help while maintaining distance, but by removing it at Luffy's lowest moment, Usopp demonstrates that true friendship requires vulnerability and being present as one's authentic self. This moment is seen as the true beginning of Usopp's path back to the crew, more significant than any formal apology could be.",

    "theoryTitle": "Rokuougan as the Ultimate Test of Willpower",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Rokuougan's true power isn't just its physical devastation, but that it tests the willpower and determination of whoever receives it. The technique appears to cause not just external damage but attacks the spirit itself. The fact that Luffy survives and eventually overcomes it after Usopp's encouragement suggests that the Rokuougan can only be defeated by someone with an unbreakable will. This theory posits that Lucci's defeat wasn't just due to Luffy's physical strength, but because Luffy's willpower and bonds with his crew proved stronger than any martial technique.",

    "theoryText": "Fans extensively debate Rob Lucci's true power level, with his Doriki rating of 4000 (nearly double that of Kaku at 2200 and Jabra at 2180) being a frequent topic of discussion. Some theorize that the Doriki system only measures physical strength and doesn't account for Devil Fruit abilities, meaning Lucci's actual combat power with his Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard is significantly higher than 4000. Episode 308 demonstrates this when Lucci's Rokuougan, enhanced by his leopard form, proves far more devastating than raw Doriki numbers would suggest. This has led to debates about how to accurately measure power in One Piece beyond simple numerical ratings.",

    "theoryText": "A psychological analysis by fans suggests that the Sogeking persona wasn't just a disguise but a coping mechanism for Usopp's guilt and shame about leaving the crew. By becoming Sogeking, Usopp could help Robin without confronting his own actions or pride. The mask represented his inability to face his mistakes head-on. Episode 308's revelation scene is theorized to be the moment when Usopp finally confronts his guilt - seeing Luffy at death's door forces him to abandon the psychological protection of the mask and face reality. This interpretation adds psychological depth to what could otherwise be seen as a simple comedic subplot.",
