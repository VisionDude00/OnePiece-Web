    "summary": "A theory that Vergo's character and the Punk Hazard arc are modeled after the Terminator franchise, with parallels suggesting Vergo may return stronger than before.",
    "fullText": "Fans have noted 'glaringly obvious Terminator parallels' that Vergo has going for him. This theory explores the connections between Vergo's character design, his 'death' scene, and classic Terminator death sequences. Some fans believe Oda created Vergo with specific intentions to parallel the Terminator franchise, suggesting that like the Terminator, Vergo is destined to 'come back' greater than ever. The theory points to visual and thematic similarities in how Vergo is defeated and speculates about his potential return in future arcs.",

    "fullText": "Episode 606's revelation of Vergo as Doflamingo's undercover agent raises questions about how deep Doflamingo's influence runs within the World Government. Fans theorize that Vergo may be just one of many such agents, and that Doflamingo's network of spies and operatives could extend far beyond what's been revealed. This theory suggests that Vergo's position as Vice Admiral was part of a decades-long infiltration plan, and that there may be other high-ranking officials working for Doflamingo throughout the Marines and World Government.",
