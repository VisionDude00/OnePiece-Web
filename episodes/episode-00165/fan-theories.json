    "fullText": "Many fans believe that the Skypiea arc contains crucial information about the Void Century and the Ancient Kingdom. The fact that Jaya was launched into the sky 400 years ago - roughly the same time period as the Void Century - suggests this wasn't a natural occurrence but possibly related to the World Government's actions. Shandora, the City of Gold, may have been home to people who knew too much about the true history, and the Knock Up Stream that launched it into the sky could have been caused by an Ancient Weapon. This would explain why there are Poneglyphs on the island.",

    "fullText": "The revelation that the City of Gold exists and that Noland was telling the truth has sparked theories about his true purpose. Some fans believe Noland wasn't just an explorer but may have been searching for something specific related to the Ancient Kingdom or ancient weapons.

This theory proposes that Noland may have been connected to the D. clan or worked with scholars trying to uncover the true history.",
