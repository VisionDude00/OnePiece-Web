**Recommendation:** These timestamps should be verified by watching the actual episode.

## Character Debuts

### Confirmed Debuts (Episode 163, Chapter 249):
1. **Kamakiri** - Shandian warrior, one of the strongest under Wyper
2. **Raki** - Female Shandian warrior with moderate views
3. **Braham** - Gunslinger with flash guns
4. **Genbo** - Bazooka-wielding warrior

**Note:** While Wyper and Aisa appear in this episode, they debuted earlier in the arc (Episodes 153-155), so they are not included in the debuts list.

## Voice Actors

### Confirmed:
- **Satori:** Yasuhiro Takato (JP), Chris Cason (EN)
- **Shura:** Shinichiro Ohta (JP), Kent Williams (EN)
- **Gan Fall:** Joji Yanami (JP), John Swasey (EN)

### Not Found:
- Voice actors for Kamakiri, Raki, Braham, and Genbo were not readily available in sources consulted
- These could be researched further if needed

## Opening/Ending Songs

**Opening:** "Hikari e" by The Babystars (Episodes 116-168)
**Ending:** "FAITH" by Ruppina (Episodes 157-168)

This was confirmed via the One Piece Music wiki page which lists all OP/ED songs with episode ranges.

## External Media Findings

### Limited YouTube Content
- Standard searches did not yield many YouTube-specific reaction videos for Episode 163
- Found some Patreon-exclusive content (mikeyventure)
- Found Bilibili reaction video covering episodes 162-163
- Most YouTube content focuses on broader Skypiea Arc analysis rather than individual episodes

### Available Media:
- Dailymotion clips of key battles
- Podcast discussions (The One Piece Podcast, The One Piece Virgin)
- Multiple written articles from CBR, Poggers, ChibiBytes
- Tumblr blog reviews (Never Watched One Piece)

## Fan Theories

Found one major theory connecting to this episode:
- **Monkey D. Family as Shandian Descendants** - Theory that Luffy's family descends from Kalgara
- Based on: Dragon's tattoos, Garp's dog mask, Luffy ringing the Golden Bell
- Status: Unconfirmed but popular in community

## Manga Differences

The anime extended several scenes from Chapters 249-250:
- Battle sequences between Luffy/Sanji and Satori were expanded with additional choreography
- Shandian warriors council scene was extended to give more introduction time
- These are typical anime adaptations to manage pacing

## Observations & Questions

### Strengths of This Episode:
1. **Teamwork Theme** - Excellent display of Luffy/Sanji cooperation
2. **Character Development** - Chopper's heroic moment is significant
3. **Faction Introduction** - Well-executed introduction of Shandian warriors
4. **Multiple Plotlines** - Balances three concurrent storylines effectively

### Potential Issues:
1. **Pacing** - As part of Skypiea Arc, may be considered slow by some fans
2. **Split Focus** - Episode jumps between three different locations/battles

### Questions for Further Research:
1. What is the exact dialogue in the Shandian council scene? (Would need Japanese script)
2. Are there any notable animation sakuga moments in the Satori battle?
3. Did this episode have any production issues or delays?
4. What was the fan reaction in 2003 when this originally aired?

## Spoiler Severity Decisions

### CRITICAL Severity:
- Chopper's leap into water (ep163-event-006) - Marked CRITICAL because it's a major character-defining moment showing willingness to sacrifice himself, demonstrates Devil Fruit weakness in dramatic fashion

### MAJOR Severity:
- Most battle events (Satori's defeat, Gan Fall's defeat, Shandian debuts)
- These advance plot significantly but aren't series-defining moments

### MINOR Severity:
- Usopp finding forest exit
- Giant South Bird rescue
- Some relationship reveals

**Reasoning:** Followed the guide's principle of "when in doubt, err on the side of higher severity"

## Incremental Data Approach

### What Was Included:
- Only the 4 characters who debut in this episode (Kamakiri, Raki, Braham, Genbo)
- Only Shandia Village as new location
- Only Shandian Warriors as new crew/group
- No devil fruits (none debuted or had new abilities revealed)

### What Was Excluded:
- Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Usopp (already have full profiles from earlier episodes)
- Satori, Shura, Gan Fall (debuted in earlier episodes)
- Upper Yard locations (already documented)
- Gomu Gomu no Mi, Hito Hito no Mi (already documented)

This follows the research prompt's instruction to only document what's NEW in this episode.

## Production Credits

**Animation Director:** Ken Koyama
**Key Animators:** Yūki Kinoshita
**Screenplay:** Yoshiyuki Suga
**Art Direction:** Miyuki Sato, Kumiko Fukuzawa

These credits were found in the wiki source.

## Data Quality Assessment

### High Confidence:
- Episode title, air dates, arc placement
- Character debuts (confirmed via wiki and manga chapter reference)
- Opening/Ending songs
- Voice actors (confirmed via BTVA)
- General plot summary

### Medium Confidence:
- Exact dialogue quotes (translated from Japanese, may vary)

### Low Confidence:

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. **Watch the episode** to verify timestamps and capture exact dialogue
2. **Find Japanese script** for more accurate quote translations
3. **Research animation quality** - check if there were any notable sakuga moments
4. **Search Japanese fan sites** for additional perspectives and theories
