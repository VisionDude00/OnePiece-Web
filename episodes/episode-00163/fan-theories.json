    "summary": "A theory suggesting that the Monkey D. family, including Luffy, Dragon, and Garp, are descendants of the Shandian warrior Kalgara and connected to the ancient Shandia civilization.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that the Monkey D. family might be Shandian and descendants of Kalgara, the Great Warrior of Shandora. Evidence includes: Dragon's tattoos suggesting a connection to Kalgara, Garp often wearing a dog mask similar to the canine hats worn by Shandia chiefs, and the fact that Wyper (a direct descendant of Kalgara) said only his family can ring the Golden Bell, yet Luffy was able to ring it. This connection could explain the Monkey D. family's strong sense of freedom and rebellion against oppressive authority, mirroring the Shandian warriors' 400-year struggle to reclaim their homeland.",
