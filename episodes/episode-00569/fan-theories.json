    "theoryText": "Pluton is not actually the Warship laced with weapons, but it is actually a person who possesses the voice of all things, just like Poseidon. The revelation in Episode 569 that Poseidon is a person rather than an object suggests that all three ancient weapons might follow the same pattern, with Pluton potentially being a person with a special ability rather than the warship described in the blueprints.",

    "theoryText": "Poseidon's ability to exert control over Sea Kings appears similar to Conqueror's Haki, where the user exerts their will externally onto others. This theory suggests there may be a connection between the ancient weapons and advanced forms of Haki, with Poseidon representing an ultimate form of will projection that specifically affects Sea Kings rather than general creatures.",

With her ability to command Sea Kings, Shirahoshi could save drowning humans during a worldwide flood, suggesting the ancient weapons were created to protect against catastrophic events rather than cause them.",
