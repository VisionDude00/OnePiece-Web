    "theoryText": "Hody Jones is intentionally portrayed as a villain with no personal motivation or experience of human oppression. Unlike previous antagonists who had personal trauma, Hody simply inherited hatred from the environment and adults around him. This makes him a representation of baseless racism and the cycle of hatred passed down through generations without rational basis. Oda created this character to highlight how hatred can be inherited even when the person has never personally experienced the injustice they claim to be avenging.",

    "theoryText": "Madam Shyarly's vision showing Luffy standing amid flames as Fishman Island is destroyed will eventually come true, but in a positive way. The most popular theory is that Luffy will destroy the Red Line, which would destroy Fishman Island in the process but allow fishmen and merfolk to finally live freely on the surface, fulfilling Joy Boy's ancient promise. Alternative theories include: Luffy being forced to destroy the island during a battle with Blackbeard who seeks Shirahoshi/Poseidon, or a Seraphim version of Luffy being the actual destroyer.",

His declaration in Episode 535 that 'the princess will die in a sea of blood if she becomes someone else's' demonstrates the toxic 'if I can't have you, no one can' mentality. His Devil Fruit ability (Mato Mato no Mi) that allows him to endlessly pursue targets serves as a perfect metaphor for his inability to let go of his obsession, with thrown objects following their target forever just as he has pursued Shirahoshi for years.",

Hody never experienced human oppression directly because Otohime and Jinbe's generation protected them from it, yet he still inherited the hatred. This suggests that while Otohime's movement was noble, a single generation of peace isn't enough to eliminate centuries of prejudice. The theory posits that only complete integration (fishmen living on the surface) can truly end the cycle.",
