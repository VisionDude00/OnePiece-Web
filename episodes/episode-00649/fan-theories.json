    "theoryText": "Chinjao's backstory about needing his drill head to pierce the Jewel Ice Sheet to access his treasure is foreshadowing for how to access the One Piece. The theory proposes that the One Piece treasure is hidden under ice at the North Pole, similar to how Chinjao's treasure was hidden under the ice continent. Just as Chinjao needed his drill head (and later Roger-level Haki) to pierce the ice, accessing Laugh Tale may require Joy Boy-level Haki to penetrate an ice barrier. The ice would reseal itself quickly, making it accessible only to those with extraordinary Haki abilities.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 649 symbolically shows that Luffy has reached or surpassed Garp's level from his prime. While Garp destroyed Chinjao's drill head with his punch, Luffy's punch restored it. This isn't just about raw power, but about Luffy representing a new generation that can heal the wounds created by previous generations. The theory suggests that this theme will continue throughout the series, with Luffy not just matching the previous generation's strength but surpassing them by bringing resolution and healing rather than just destruction.",
