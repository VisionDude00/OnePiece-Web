- Multiple reviews from The Fandom Post, Hogan Reviews, and The One Piece Podcast

### Animation Quality
Episode 553 received significant praise for its animation, particularly:
- Luffy emerging from Megalo's mouth and kicking Hody Jones
- The One Piece Podcast specifically called it "some of the coolest animation on a TV budget, period"
- Classified as "ENHANCED" animation quality for this episode

### Key Revelations in This Episode
