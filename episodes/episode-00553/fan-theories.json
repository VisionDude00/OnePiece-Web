    "theoryText": "Shirahoshi's revelation about keeping Otohime's secret demonstrates her incredible emotional strength and willpower. This, combined with her identity as the Ancient Weapon Poseidon who can command Sea Kings, suggests she will play a crucial role in the series' endgame. Her commitment to her mother's ideals of peace, even in the face of knowing her killer, parallels themes that will likely emerge in the final conflict between different ideologies in the One Piece world.",

This could involve destroying the Red Line, which would cause debris to crush Fish-Man Island but also fulfill the ancient dream of fish-men and humans living together in the sunlight. Shirahoshi's role as Poseidon would be crucial in evacuating everyone using Sea Kings.",

    "theoryText": "Hody's role as the killer of Queen Otohime and his framing of a human pirate represents how hatred can be manufactured and perpetuated across generations. The theory suggests that Hody has no real reason to hate humans - he's simply a product of his environment, raised to hate. This contrasts with Shirahoshi's choice to break the cycle of hatred by honoring her mother's wish. This theme will likely be explored further, revealing that Hody's hatred is empty and learned rather than based on any real grievance.",
