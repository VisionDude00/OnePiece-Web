    "summary": "The Warship Island arc may have accidentally foreshadowed Luffy's ability to hear the Voice of All Things, revealed much later in the series.",
    "fullText": "During the Warship Island arc, Luffy is shown to be able to understand and communicate with the dragon Ryu, despite not having Apis's Hiso Hiso no Mi powers. This seemingly filler-only ability was later paralleled in canon when Luffy was revealed in Chapter 648 (Zou arc) to possess the ability to hear the Voice of All Things, allowing him to understand Sea Kings and other beings. While the Warship Island arc is non-canon, some fans theorize that this may have been an early, unintentional hint at Luffy's latent ability - or that the anime staff may have been given hints about this future plot point by Oda.",

    "summary": "The Warship Island arc creates a major continuity issue with later canon events regarding the existence of dragons in the One Piece world.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest issues fans have identified with the Warship Island arc being non-canon is the dragon continuity problem. In this filler arc (episodes 54-61), the Straw Hats encounter and help Sennenryu dragons, treating them as real creatures. However, in later canon arcs, the crew acts as if dragons are purely fictional. During the Thriller Bark Arc, Zoro expresses doubt about dragons existing, and during the Punk Hazard Arc, both Luffy and Zoro treat Vegapunk's artificial dragon as unprecedented, with them even calling dragons 'fictional creatures.' This has led fans to debate whether the anime staff simply didn't coordinate with the manga's future storylines, or if there's a distinction between the 'real' Sennenryu of the filler arc and the artificial/legendary dragons of the canon story. Most fans accept this as a simple continuity error resulting from the filler arc's non-canon status.",

    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Eiichiro Oda may have provided input or approval for the Warship Island arc, given his rare public praise of it.",
    "fullText": "The Warship Island arc is unique among One Piece filler arcs because creator Eiichiro Oda publicly praised it in an early February issue of Weekly Shonen Jump - one of the only times he has commented on filler content. Additionally, this arc was later adapted into a novelization titled 'Legend of the Sennenryu' in December 2001, and as of 2025, it remains the only filler arc adapted to prose. These facts have led some fans to theorize that Oda may have been more involved with this arc than typical filler, possibly providing story concepts or approval. Some speculate this could explain elements like Luffy's ability to understand Ryu (which parallels his later canon Voice of All Things ability) or the arc's placement as a bridge between Loguetown and the Grand Line. However, there's no concrete evidence of Oda's direct involvement beyond his published praise, and the arc's numerous canon contradictions suggest it was still primarily an anime-only creation.",
