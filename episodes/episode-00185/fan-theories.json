    "theoryText": "There are numerous parallels between Imu and Enel throughout the series. Just as Sanji sabotaged the Ark Maxim during the Skypiea arc to hinder Enel's plans, it would be fitting and thematically consistent for Sanji to play a similar role against Imu by damaging Uranus or the Mother Flame, breaking its gears and hindering Imu's goals in the final saga.",

    "theoryText": "While it's confirmed that Sanji sabotaged the Ark Maxim's main engine during his infiltration, the exact method he used has never been explicitly shown in either the manga or anime. Theories range from: (1) Sanji physically kicked and damaged critical engine components, (2) He disconnected vital electrical systems, (3) He sabotaged the gold conducting systems, or (4) He damaged the dial-based propulsion mechanisms. The speed at which he accomplished this while also planning the rescue suggests either exceptional technical knowledge or very effective targeted destruction.",

    "relevantCharacters": ["sanji"],
    "evidencePoints": [
      "Sanji split up from Usopp supposedly to maximize rescue chances, giving him time alone to sabotage",
      "The ship's malfunctions occurred immediately after Sanji collapsed, suggesting recent damage",
      "Enel's frustration indicates the damage was significant despite backup systems",
      "Sanji had no apparent technical training, suggesting physical sabotage rather than technical hacking",
      "The black clouds stopped and electrical connections failed, pointing to engine/power system damage"
