      "significance": "This is one of the most heroic and selfless moments in Sanji's character arc. Despite knowing the attack could kill him, he doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself to save both Nami and Usopp. This moment transcends his usual 'chivalry toward women' character trait, showing he values all his crewmates' lives.

His ability to remain conscious after such a devastating attack, maintain his composure, and deliver a cool one-liner while smoking demonstrates incredible willpower and badassery. The scene has become legendary among fans and is frequently referenced and celebrated in the One Piece community. It perfectly encapsulates Sanji's character: cool under pressure, defiant in the face of overwhelming power, and maintaining his style even at death's door.",

This strategic thinking shows Sanji's intelligence and tactical mind, as he understood the larger threat the Ark Maxim posed. The sabotage will play a crucial role in the eventual defeat of Enel's plans.
