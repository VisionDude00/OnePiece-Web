    "theoryText": "Many fans theorized that Law's actual plan was to take down Doflamingo for what he did to Corazon (Rosinante), but he masked his true intentions by telling Luffy he wanted to take down Kaido. Law used the alliance as a means to get revenge on the man who killed his benefactor while making it appear to be a strategic move against an Emperor.",

    "theoryTitle": "Luffy's Understanding of Alliances is Fundamentally Different",
    "theoryText": "Fans theorized that Luffy doesn't truly understand what a 'pirate alliance' means in the traditional strategic sense. While Law sees it as a professional arrangement with clear objectives, Luffy perceives the alliance as practically a friendship and doesn't distinguish between allies and nakama. This fundamental difference in understanding would lead to complications but also to the alliance's unique strength.",

    "theoryTitle": "The 'Key on Punk Hazard' References Caesar and SMILE Production",
    "theoryText": "When Law mentioned there's a 'key on Punk Hazard that can upset the balance of the New World,' fans speculated this referred to Caesar Clown's SMILE production facility. By capturing Caesar and destroying the SMILE factory, they could disrupt the supply chain to Kaido, weakening the Emperor before confronting him directly. This would also provoke conflict between Kaido and Doflamingo.",

    "theoryText": "Fans joked that Law's expression during and after the alliance proposal showed he would 'deeply regret this but am in way too deep to back out now.' They theorized that Law underestimated how chaotic and unpredictable working with Luffy would be, and that his carefully laid plans would constantly be derailed by Luffy's impulsive nature.",

    "theoryText": "When Law proposed the alliance, fans immediately began debating which of the Four Emperors Law intended to target. While Law's voice was carried away by the wind in the anime, manga readers knew it was Kaido. Some anime-only fans theorized it could be Big Mom, Shanks, or even Blackbeard, leading to extensive speculation about the alliance's true goal.",
