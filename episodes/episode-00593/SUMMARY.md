## Synopsis

After learning that Nami (in Franky's body) has been kidnapped by the Yeti Cool Brothers, Luffy and Franky pursue them across the snowy mountains of Punk Hazard. During the confrontation, Franky consumes a Rumble Ball and transforms uncontrollably into Monster Point. Luffy battles the Yeti Cool Brothers using his post-timeskip abilities, debuting the Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun technique. Trafalgar Law intervenes, defeats the Yeti Cool Brothers with Counter Shock, and proposes a historic pirate alliance with Luffy to take down one of the Four Emperors - a moment that will define the next several major story arcs.
