The theory suggests that Yoru is seeking the most powerful swordsman so it can finally have a suitable wielder. The battles with Zoro and Shanks were conducted to test out their capabilities as swordsmen and determine if they are worthy.",

This would be beautiful symbolism of Zoro's inner balance and completion as a swordsman, as well as representing the purity of his promise to Kuina. The theory is significant to Episode 24 because Wado Ichimonji was the only sword that survived Mihawk's attack.",
