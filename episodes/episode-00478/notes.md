# Episode 478 Research Notes

## Research Completed: 2025-12-14

### Episode Overview
Episode 478 "To Live Up to a Promise! Luffy and Coby Collide!" is a pivotal episode in the Marineford Arc, featuring one of the most significant power reveals in One Piece - Luffy's first clear manifestation of Conqueror's Haki.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Conqueror's Haki Debut
- This is the first **undeniable** display of Luffy possessing Conqueror's Haki
- Previous hint: Episode 389 (Duval's bull Motobaro), but this is the first clear, acknowledged use
- Luffy uses it unconsciously, showing he cannot yet control it
- Reactions from Admirals, Garp, Ace, and others confirm its significance
- Marked as ULTRA_SECRET severity due to its importance to Luffy's character development

#### 2. Emotional Callbacks
- Episode creates strong emotional connections to Episode 1 through Luffy and Koby's confrontation
- Their parallel journeys since the beginning are highlighted
- Despite being on opposite sides, their mutual respect remains

#### 3. Marineford War Progression
- This episode marks a turning point where:
  - Whitebeard's top commanders (Marco, Jozu) are defeated
  - Luffy's true potential is revealed to the world
  - The execution is stopped (temporarily)

#### 4. Production Quality
- Animation quality marked as HIGH for this episode
- TV rating: 10.7%, ranked 4th in time slot
- Opening: "One day" by The ROOTLESS (episodes 459-492)
- No ending theme (standard for this period)

### Manga Differences
- Anime omits Jango fainting from Luffy's Haki (shown in manga Chapter 569)
- Battle sequences and reactions are extended for dramatic effect
- Episode adapts Chapter 569 pages 2-15

### Voice Actor Notes
- Kinryu Arimoto (Whitebeard's Japanese VA) passed away February 1, 2019
- This is one of his most memorable performances in the series

### Research Challenges

#### Limited Script Access
- Could not locate full episode script/transcript
- Relied on wiki summaries, episode viewing descriptions, and fan reactions
- Timestamps are approximate based on typical episode pacing

#### External Media
- Found multiple reaction videos, primarily on Bilibili and Patreon
- Most reactions focus on the Conqueror's Haki moment
- Limited podcast coverage specific to this episode

### Character Analysis

#### Luffy
- Demonstrates extreme determination despite warnings about hormone side effects
- Shows growth in power but also naivety (doesn't understand his own Haki)
- Willing to sacrifice his health/life for Ace

#### Koby
- Growth since Episode 1 is evident but still far behind Luffy
- Shows courage in confronting Luffy despite knowing he'll lose
- Upholds his promise/dream as a Marine

#### Boa Hancock
- Fully commits to Luffy's side, betraying her Warlord position
- Destroys Pacifistas (Marine weapons) without hesitation
- Love for Luffy overrides all other allegiances

### Thematic Elements
1. **Unwavering Determination** - Luffy's refusal to give up
2. **Power of Will** - Conqueror's Haki as manifestation of willpower
3. **Parallel Journeys** - Luffy and Koby's respective paths
4. **Sacrifice and Loyalty** - Multiple characters demonstrate extreme loyalty

### Quality Assurance Notes
- All events have appropriate severity ratings
- Conqueror's Haki marked as ULTRA_SECRET (correct for such a major reveal)
- Character IDs follow kebab-case convention
- All timestamps approximate but reasonable
- Cross-references to setup/payoff episodes included where relevant

### Future Research Considerations
- Episode 479 continues directly from this cliffhanger
- Episodes 483-485 will show consequences of Luffy's hormone use
- Episode 516+ shows Luffy learning to control Haki during timeskip
