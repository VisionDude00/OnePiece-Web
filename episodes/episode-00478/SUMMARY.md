Koby confronts him to uphold their promise from Episode 1, but is quickly defeated with a single Gomu Gomu no Bullet.

As Whitebeard's commanders Marco and Jozu fall to the Admirals, and the execution is about to proceed, Luffy unleashes an unconscious burst of Conqueror's Haki that knocks out the executioners and stuns everyone at Marineford. This marks the first clear manifestation of Luffy's rare ability, shocking the Admirals and confirming his potential as a true king.
