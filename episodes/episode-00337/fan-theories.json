    "theoryText": "Many fans believe that Brook's backstory is a modern-day retelling of what happened to Joy Boy at the close of the Void Century. The parallels include: a crew making promises, tragic deaths, and one survivor carrying on the legacy. Brook's story of waiting decades to fulfill a promise to Laboon may mirror Joy Boy's promise that created the One Piece treasure itself.",
