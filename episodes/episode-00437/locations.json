    "description": "Level 5 of Impel Down, known as 'Freezing Hell,' is the exact opposite of Level 4's Burning Hell. It is a frozen wasteland where the temperature is so cold that prisoners either suffer for a lifetime in severe cold or freeze to death. The food given to prisoners is frozen to the point of being virtually inedible. Army Wolves patrol this level, hunting down any prisoners who try to escape.",
    "significance": "Level 5 houses criminals with bounties of 100,000,000 Berries and over. It represents one of the most brutal levels of Impel Down, using extreme cold as torture. The contrast between Level 4's heat and Level 5's cold demonstrates the sadistic design of the prison.",
