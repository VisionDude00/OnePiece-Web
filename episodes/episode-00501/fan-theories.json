    "summary": "Many fans theorize that Dragon's experiences growing up in the Goa Kingdom, witnessing the extreme class divide and nobility's cruelty, directly motivated him to form the Revolutionary Army and fight against the World Government's oppressive system.",
    "fullText": "Dragon's revelation in Episode 501 that he was born in the Goa Kingdom provides crucial insight into his revolutionary motivations. Fans theorize that Dragon likely grew up witnessing the same class-based oppression that Sabo experienced, potentially even in Gray Terminal or Edgetown based on visual composition in the manga. The corrupt nobility's treatment of the poor, culminating in the Gray Terminal fire, represents on a small scale the same injustices perpetrated by the World Government worldwide. Dragon's shock and sympathy when Sabo denounces the nobility suggests deep personal connection to these issues. This theory posits that Dragon's childhood experiences in Goa Kingdom planted the seeds of revolution, making his encounter with Sabo particularly meaningful as he sees his younger self in the boy.",

    "summary": "A widely-discussed theory suggests that Conqueror's Haki has a genetic component and can be inherited from parents to children, with Ace inheriting it from Gol D. Roger as key evidence.",
    "fullText": "Ace's manifestation of Conqueror's Haki at age 10 in Episode 501 is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the theory that Supreme King Haki can be inherited genetically. The theory points to several parent-child pairs who both possess this rare ability: Gol D. Roger and Portgas D. Ace, Monkey D. Garp/Dragon and Monkey D. Luffy, Big Mom and Charlotte Katakuri, and Kaido and Yamato. This pattern suggests a genetic component to Conqueror's Haki, though it's noted that not all siblings inherit it (as seen with Katakuri being the only one among his siblings to possess it, same with Doflamingo and Boa Hancock). The fact that Ace unconsciously manifests this ability as a child, before knowing his father's identity or legacy, strongly suggests it's an inherited trait rather than purely learned. While Oda has not explicitly confirmed this theory, the mounting evidence makes it one of the most widely accepted fan theories in the community.",

    "summary": "Fans theorize that Dragon's encounter with Sabo at the Gray Terminal gates in Episode 501 was the beginning of a deliberate recruitment, as Dragon saw Sabo's potential as a future revolutionary leader.",
    "fullText": "When Dragon met Sabo at the Gray Terminal gates, he witnessed a noble child who had completely rejected his privileged upbringing to stand with the oppressed. This theory suggests that Dragon immediately recognized Sabo's potential as a revolutionary and that their conversation was the first step in what would become Sabo's recruitment into the Revolutionary Army. The theory posits that Dragon likely kept track of Sabo after this encounter, and when Sabo's ship was destroyed by the Celestial Dragon and he lost his memory, Dragon took the opportunity to save him and bring him into the fold. The fact that Sabo eventually became the Revolutionary Army's Chief of Staff suggests Dragon saw exceptional leadership qualities in the young boy from their very first meeting. Some fans even speculate that Dragon may have intentionally stayed in the Goa Kingdom area precisely to observe the nobles' plan and potentially recruit sympathizers.",

    "summary": "Fans interpret the Gray Terminal fire as a microcosm of the World Government's systematic oppression, with the Goa Kingdom's class structure mirroring the global hierarchy maintained by the Celestial Dragons.",
    "fullText": "The Gray Terminal incident in Episode 501 is theorized to be Oda's deliberate allegory for the World Government's treatment of the entire world. Just as the Goa Kingdom nobility burns Gray Terminal and its residents to maintain their 'most beautiful kingdom' facade for visiting Celestial Dragons, the World Government maintains global order through violence and oppression to preserve the Celestial Dragons' power. The locked gates preventing escape parallel the Red Line and Calm Belts that physically divide the world. The nobles' willingness to commit mass murder for appearances mirrors the World Government's buster calls and destruction of entire islands to hide uncomfortable truths. This theory suggests that Dragon's comment about being born in the Goa Kingdom wasn't just personal history—it was his recognition that the kingdom's microcosm revealed the macrocosm of global oppression he fights against. The fire that destroys Gray Terminal becomes a symbol of the destructive force of unchecked power and class division throughout the One Piece world.",
