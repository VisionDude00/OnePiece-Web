    "description": "A critical review of the Little East Blue Arc (episodes 426-429) that examines the arc's promotional purpose for Strong World, its cultural themes, and its interruption of the Impel Down storyline. The reviewer notes disappointment that the arc didn't explore East Blue diaspora culture as hoped and criticizes the villains as 'weird kinda-racist caricatures of Mexicans.'",
