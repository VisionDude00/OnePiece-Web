    "summary": "Some fans theorize that while the Little East Blue Arc is filler, Boss or similar modified creatures might appear in the canon storyline since Shiki's escape from Impel Down is canon.",
    "fullText": "While the Little East Blue Arc is anime-only filler, Boss represents Dr. Indigo's biological modification technology for Shiki's plans. Since Shiki's escape from Impel Down is mentioned in the canon manga, some fans theorize that similar modified creatures or the technology behind them could appear in the main storyline. The concept of artificially enhanced animals could be revisited in later arcs dealing with scientific experimentation.",

    "summary": "Fans have discussed that the Ami Ami no Mi, despite being from a filler arc, demonstrates an interesting concept for a Devil Fruit that could be quite powerful if used by a more creative or strategic user.",
    "fullText": "The Ami Ami no Mi's ability to create customized nets based on ingested materials and transform the user's body into a net structure shows creative Paramecia applications. Fans have noted that Largo, while competent, didn't fully explore the fruit's potential. A more strategic user could potentially create nets from various exotic materials, use the body transformation more defensively, or develop awakening abilities. The fruit's 'elemental' net creation (fire nets, water nets) hints at versatility comparable to some Logia fruits. However, as an anime-only fruit, these discussions remain purely theoretical.",
