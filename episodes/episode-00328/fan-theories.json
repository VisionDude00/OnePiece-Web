    "summary": "A theory that the powerful enemy who destroyed the Phoenix Pirates in the New World was Admiral Akainu (Sakazuki), based on the appearance of the attacking ship and the magma-like attacks.",
    "fullText": "Some fans have theorized that the vessel that destroyed the Phoenix Pirates in their flashback resembled a Marine Warship and the attacks looked like magma projectiles, suggesting Admiral Akainu may have been responsible for their defeat. This would explain why even a crew with a 100 million bounty captain was so thoroughly crushed - they encountered one of the Navy's most powerful fighters. However, since the Ice Hunter Arc is non-canon filler, this would not have any bearing on the main story.",
