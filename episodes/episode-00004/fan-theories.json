    "summary": "Theory that Shanks didn't lose his arm simply to save Luffy, but because that arm had been marked by Imu, and sacrificing it was necessary for a larger purpose.",
    "fullText": "According to recent revelations in One Piece chapter 1152, the arm that Shanks lost was the same one that Imu had marked. This has led fans to theorize that Shanks didn't just lose his arm to save Luffy from the Sea King - he may have needed to sacrifice that specific arm because of Imu's mark. Some fans suggest this was a strategic decision by Shanks to prevent Imu from tracking or controlling him, while others believe it was part of a larger plan related to Luffy's destiny. This theory reframes one of the series' most emotional moments as a calculated sacrifice with implications far beyond just saving a child.",

    "summary": "Theory debating whether Shanks, as a powerful pirate who later became a Yonko, actually needed to lose his arm to save Luffy from a relatively weak Sea King.",
    "fullText": "Many fans have debated whether Shanks truly needed to sacrifice his arm to save Luffy from the Lord of the Coast. Given that Shanks later became one of the Four Emperors and demonstrated immense power, including Conqueror's Haki (which he used immediately after losing the arm to scare away the same Sea King), it seems he could have saved Luffy without losing a limb. Popular theories include: 1) Shanks intentionally sacrificed his arm to inspire Luffy and give him a physical reminder of their bond, 2) Shanks was caught off-guard and couldn't react in time, 3) The sacrifice was symbolic and Shanks chose to lose the arm to demonstrate his faith in Luffy's potential, 4) Something about the situation prevented Shanks from using his full power. This debate has raged in the fandom since the episode aired, with Oda's editor later revealing that the arm loss was added to make the scene more impactful.",

    "fullText": "Fans have long theorized that Luffy's straw hat is more than just a symbol of his promise with Shanks. The hat's journey from Gol D. Roger to Shanks to Luffy suggests it may be an important artifact with connections to the Void Century or Joy Boy. Evidence includes: 1) A giant frozen straw hat shown in Mary Geoise, suggesting historical significance, 2) Roger wearing the same style hat, 3) The hat's prominence in the series title and imagery, 4) Shanks' emotional attachment to it beyond normal sentimentality. Some theories propose the hat is a key to something, a symbol of inherited will across generations, or even contains some hidden property or message. Episode 4 establishes the hat's transfer from Shanks to Luffy, making this moment retroactively more significant if the theories prove true.",

    "fullText": "With the later revelation that the Gomu Gomu no Mi is actually the mythical Zoan Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, fans have theorized about Shanks' knowledge and intentions. Did Shanks know the fruit's true nature when he acquired it? Did he intentionally bring it to Luffy's village? Some evidence: 1) Shanks went out of his way to acquire this fruit, 2) He kept it in an easily accessible chest rather than secured, 3) He seemed relatively calm about Luffy eating such a 'valuable' fruit, 4) His later actions suggest he was betting on Luffy's generation. This theory reframes Episode 4's fruit-eating scene from a random accident to a potentially orchestrated event, though it's unclear if Shanks intended for Luffy specifically to eat it or just wanted it available for someone worthy.",
