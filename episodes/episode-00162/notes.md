## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- Could not locate a full episode script for detailed line-by-line annotation
- Relied on wiki summaries, reviews, and episode descriptions
- Quotes are accurate to character but may not be exact word-for-word from episode

### Minimal Episode-Specific Analysis
- Most external media found focuses on the Skypiea arc as a whole rather than Episode 162 specifically
- Only 2 reaction videos found (Bilibili and Patreon)
- Only 1 detailed episode-specific review (Never Watched One Piece Tumblr blog)

### Timestamp Limitations
- No official sources with precise timestamps for events
- Had to estimate based on episode structure and event sequence
- Future editors should verify timestamps if episode is watched

## Questions for Future Research

1. **Pirates 20 Years Ago:** Gan Fall mentions pirates who became his friends - is this definitively Noland's crew or different pirates? Needs cross-reference with Noland timeline.

2. **The Mysterious Song:** What is the song that both started and might end the conflict? Is this resolved later in the arc?

3. **Ordeal Survival Rates:** Shura claims 3% survival rate - is this accurate or boastful? How many actually survived?

4. **Going Merry Damage:** How much damage does the ship sustain in this episode? Important for tracking ongoing ship deterioration that leads to later arcs.

5. **Mantra/Haki:** Episode shows Shura using Mantra - would be valuable to document all instances of Observation Haki in Skypiea for retroactive analysis post-Haki revelation.

## Recommendations for Future Editors

1. **Verify Timestamps:** Watch episode and update all timestamps with precise timing
2. **Add Quotes:** Include exact dialogue from episode script when available
3. **Find More Media:** Search for additional YouTube reactions, analyses, and podcasts
4. **Cross-Reference:** Link to related episodes (Gan Fall's debut, Going Merry damage arc)
5. **Images:** Add official screenshots, character images, and location visuals
6. **Manga Comparison:** Detailed comparison with Chapters 248-249 for differences

## Final Notes

This episode serves as a strong character moment for Chopper, showcasing his growth since joining the crew. The contrast between his terror and his determination creates compelling drama. Shura is established as a formidable opponent with unique abilities, and Gan Fall's dual role as exposition provider and action hero works well.

The episode balances action (Chopper vs Shura, Gan Fall vs Shura) with important world-building (Skypiea history, conflict origins). While not a marquee episode with major plot twists, it's a solid mid-arc episode that advances multiple storylines.

**Research Quality:** Confident in accuracy despite lack of full script. Multiple source cross-referencing provides reliable data foundation. Timestamps should be considered estimates pending episode viewing verification.

**Total Research Time:** Comprehensive web research conducted across multiple sources to ensure accuracy and thoroughness.
