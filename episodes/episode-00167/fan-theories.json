    "fullText": "This theory proposes that the Klabautermann may have been created by the Great Kingdom as a protective measure against the imminent danger of the great flood that was about to sink the world into the sea. The ship spirits would ensure that well-loved vessels could continue sailing and protecting their crews even in the most dire circumstances. This would explain why the Klabautermann appears to ships that are deeply loved and cared for by their crews - it's a remnant of ancient technology or magic designed to preserve important vessels during catastrophic events.",

    "fullText": "Reddit user GreatGomp presented a theory that Imu might be a Klabautermann of the Ancient Kingdom. The theory suggests that the Ancient Kingdom was essentially a giant ship that continuously sailed throughout the One Piece seas, similar to how Germa66's Kingdom is a ship. Imu's immortality may be due to the longevity of the ship of the Ancient Kingdom itself, possibly connected to the Mother Flame. According to this theory, Imu is trying to keep the Ancient Kingdom a secret to save himself from the guilt of letting the people on his ship die. This would explain Imu's mysterious nature and connection to the world's ancient history. The first appearance of the Klabautermann in Episode 167 may have been foreshadowing this massive reveal.",

    "fullText": "After his defeat by Luffy in the Skypiea arc, Enel departed to the moon using his Ark Maxim. On the moon, he discovered through wall paintings that Skypieans, Shandians, and Birkans all originated from the moon city, and the inhabitants left for the Blue Planet after using up their resources. Recent chapters have suggested that the Ark Maxim may have been inspired by the Ancient Weapon Uranus. The theory proposes that Enel will return to the Blue Planet during the final war, bringing with him crucial information about the ancient civilization, the three worlds (moon, sky, and sea), and possibly ancient technology or allies from the moon. His return would provide key lore about the Moon People and could make him a wild card in the final conflict - neither fully allied with the Straw Hats nor the World Government. The mention of the Ark Maxim in Episode 167 was the first hint of this grand plan.",

    "fullText": "Recent manga chapters have shown a ship resembling the Ark Maxim in ancient murals, suggesting Enel likely drew inspiration from the Ancient Weapon Uranus to create his flying ship. The theory proposes that either the blueprints for Uranus existed on Birka (Enel's homeland) or on Skypiea, or that the Ark Maxim itself might be a prototype or incomplete version of Uranus. This would explain how Enel, despite being from an isolated sky island, was able to construct a ship capable of reaching the moon. The technology required for such a feat would need to come from the ancient civilization. When Enel mentioned his 'dream world' and the nearly-complete Ark Maxim in Episode 167, he may have been unknowingly working with ancient technology that will become crucial to understanding the world's history and the final war.",

    "fullText": "Usopp being chosen as the first crew member to witness the Klabautermann is significant. The theory suggests this wasn't random - the ship spirit appeared to Usopp specifically because of his deep love for the Going Merry and his role as the ship's unofficial repairman. Despite his cowardice, Usopp had the strongest emotional bond with the ship, treating it with care and respect that the others didn't always show. This moment in Episode 167 foreshadows Usopp's character development and his eventual confrontation with Luffy over the Going Merry's fate in Water 7. The Klabautermann appearing to Usopp validates his feelings and his role as the heart of the crew - the one who maintains their bonds and their ship. It's also seen as foreshadowing his eventual achievement of becoming a brave warrior of the sea, as someone worthy of witnessing and understanding the ship's spirit.",
