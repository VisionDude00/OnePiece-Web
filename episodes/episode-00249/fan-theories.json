    "theoryTitle": "Franky Will Rebuild Pluton for the Final War",
    "theoryText": "Since Franky memorized the Pluton blueprints before destroying them, there is bound to be a point in One Piece when the World Government will acquire an Ancient Weapon and put it to use against the pirates. The blueprints will finally serve their purpose when Franky decides to build the second Pluton by himself to counter the World Government's weapon. This theory suggests that Tom's decision to pass the blueprints to his apprentices wasn't just about safeguarding them, but ensuring they could be used if absolutely necessary.",

    "theoryTitle": "Pluton is Actually a Drill, Not Just a Ship",
    "theoryText": "Based on the Greek god Pluto (whose name translates to 'Ruler of the Underground') and the geological term 'pluton' (crystallized magma), this theory suggests Pluton is actually a drill that lies dormant beneath the earth. While it could easily destroy islands as stated, it could also create new islands by drilling into the earth and releasing magma into the ocean. This would explain why Tom described it as 'the most monstrous ship ever made' - it's not just destructive, but has world-altering capabilities. The blueprints Tom showed in Episode 249 may have depicted this dual nature.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Five Elders may have intentionally allowed Spandam's conspiracy to fail in obtaining the Pluton blueprints. By having Tom executed and the blueprints passed to Iceburg (and eventually Franky), the World Government could track the blueprints' location while appearing to have failed. This would explain why they later sent CP9 - a more competent organization - to Water 7. Spandam's role in Episode 249 might have been part of a longer game by the Five Elders to eventually locate and secure the blueprints.",

    "theoryText": "Tom's philosophy revealed in this arc - that a shipwright should take pride in their ships regardless of how they're used - represents a deeper theme about freedom and responsibility. This theory suggests that Tom's belief will be crucial to the series' ending, possibly relating to how the Straw Hats approach the final conflict. Just as Tom built Roger's ship without regret, the Straw Hats' approach to freedom (doing what they believe is right without worrying about judgment) mirrors this philosophy. Episode 249's revelation of Tom's beliefs may be foreshadowing for how the crew will handle endgame moral dilemmas.",
