    "theoryText": "Noko's obsession with becoming a Sennenryu (Millennial Dragon) directly references the creatures from the earlier Warship Island filler arc (episodes 54-61). Some fans theorize that Noko may have encountered or heard tales of the actual Sennenryu from that arc, inspiring his misguided belief that inflation and flight would transform him into one. This would create continuity between two otherwise unrelated filler arcs.",

    "theoryText": "In the Ocean's Dream Arc, Robin is notably the only crew member whose memories aren't completely stolen by Noko. Some analysts have suggested this was intentional foreshadowing by the anime staff for Robin's upcoming prominence in the Water 7/Enies Lobby arc. Robin's ability to maintain her memories could symbolically represent her deeper connection to her past and the secrets she carries, which would become central in the next major arc.",

    "theoryText": "When Luffy loses all his memories in episode 224 but still instinctively fights and uses his Devil Fruit powers to attack Noko, some fans have theorized this could be an early (unintentional) demonstration of concepts that would later be explained through Haki - specifically the idea that a fighter's will and spirit transcend conscious thought. While Haki wasn't formally introduced until much later, Luffy's body 'remembering' how to fight despite complete amnesia could be seen as thematic groundwork for the concept of willpower operating at an instinctive level.",
