## Episode Overview
Episode 224 is the final episode of the Ocean's Dream Arc (episodes 220-224), a filler arc based on the PlayStation video game "One Piece: Ocean's Dream". This is a non-canon arc that takes place between the Long Ring Long Land Arc and the start of the Water 7 Arc.

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Availability
- Could not locate a full transcript or script for this episode
- Had to rely on episode summaries, wiki entries, and reviews for plot details
- Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and plot progression

### Filler Arc Context
- As a filler arc conclusion, this episode resolves storylines introduced in episodes 220-223
- No new major characters or locations debut in this episode
- Focus is on concluding Noko's arc and the memory restoration plot

## Key Research Findings

### Character Analysis
**Noko (The Seahorse Antagonist)**
- Main villain of the Ocean's Dream Arc
- His motivation (becoming a Sennenryu) connects to the earlier Warship Island filler arc (episodes 54-61)
- Powers include: hypnosis, dream infiltration, memory theft, and creating illusions from stolen memories
- Defeated by Luffy in this episode, releasing all stolen memories
- Voice actors: Keiichi Sonobe (JP), Cris George (EN)

**Drim**
- Young boy who was hypnotically controlled by Noko throughout the arc
- Revealed to be innocent victim with no memory of his controlled actions
- Reunites with mother after Noko's defeat
- Inadvertently causes villagers to attack Straw Hats due to misunderstanding
- Voice actors: Chinami Nishimura (JP), Mary Morgan (EN)

### Thematic Elements
1. **Memory and Identity**: Core theme exploring how memories define who we are
