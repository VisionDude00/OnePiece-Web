    "theory": "A fan theory suggests that Sanji's superhuman durability displayed during the Arlong Park arc, particularly his ability to withstand Kuroobi's powerful Fish-Man Karate attacks underwater, foreshadows the later revelation in the Whole Cake Island arc about his Germa 66 genetic modifications. The theory proposes that Oda was subtly hinting at Sanji's enhanced physical abilities from the very beginning of the series.",

    "theory": "The name 'Tatsu Maki' (龍巻き) is a deliberate wordplay by Oda. While it means 'tornado' in Japanese, it also references a dragon (龍/tatsu), which may foreshadow Zoro's later connection to dragon imagery and Wano arc developments. Some fans theorize this is an early hint at Zoro's eventual mastery of techniques that manifest dragon-like auras.",

    "title": "Hatchan's Defeat Symbolizes Quality Over Quantity Theme",
    "theory": "Fans have noted that Hatchan's defeat by Zoro in Episode 39 establishes a recurring theme in One Piece: that quality, skill, and mastery are more important than raw numbers or resources. This theme resonates throughout the series, from Zoro's three swords defeating six, to Luffy's small crew defeating massive organizations. The theory suggests this battle was deliberately designed to establish this core One Piece philosophy early in the series.",
