    "theory": "Some fans theorize that certain Rokushiki techniques, particularly Tekkai (Iron Body), Shigan (Finger Gun), and Rokuogan (Six King Gun), are actually rudimentary or physical-based forms of Armament Haki, predating the formal introduction of Haki in the series. The theory suggests that Oda created CP9 and their techniques before fully developing the Haki system, and later retconned some similarities.",

    "theory": "An interesting observation by fans is that CP9 members (Rob Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, Blueno) used their actual real names during their five-year undercover operation in Water 7, despite Rob Lucci being an infamous name in certain circles. This led to theories about either: (1) CP9's arrogance and confidence that they wouldn't be discovered, (2) The World Government's power being so absolute that using real names didn't matter, or (3) A writing oversight by Oda that fans have embraced as character development showing CP9's hubris.",

    "theory": "Fans theorize that Blueno's ability to create 'air doors' that lead to a different space isn't just creating portals, but actually accesses a pocket dimension or alternate space that exists parallel to the normal world. This theory gained traction as it would explain how the doors in mid-air work and where they lead. Some speculate this pocket dimension could be connected to other spatial Devil Fruits or even the Revolutionary Army's techniques shown later in the series.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Robin discovered CP9's true identities before the assassination attempt on Iceburg, and that's why she was willing to work with them - she had been gathering intelligence and waiting for the right moment. This theory suggests Robin's actions weren't purely reactive to Aokiji's threat, but that she had been investigating Water 7's secrets independently and uncovered the CP9 infiltration, making her cooperation more strategic than it initially appears.",

Fans theorize that Iceburg had already passed them to Franky years earlier (as revealed later), and the 'blueprints' that Paulie was protecting were decoys or unrelated documents. This would explain why Iceburg seemed relatively calm despite the attack - he knew CP9 wouldn't find what they were looking for even if they succeeded.",
