## 📝 Research Notes

### Episode Classification
This is a **filler episode** - it does not adapt manga content and was created to give the manga time to progress. It's part of the Post-Arabasta filler arc where each episode focuses on a different crew member's dream:
- Episode 131: Chopper's medical dream
- Episode 132: Nami's cartography dream

### Thematic Significance
Despite being filler, this episode provides meaningful character development:
- Explores Nami's dream in depth
- Shows Bell-mère's lasting influence on Nami
- Demonstrates Nami's freedom to pursue her goals post-Arlong
- Reinforces series themes of dreams, freedom, and determination

### Production Notes
- Final episode to use "Shining ray" as ending theme
- Part of Season 5 Post-Arabasta content
- Approximately 7.5 years between Japanese and US broadcast
- IMDb rating of 6.5/10 indicates mixed but generally positive reception
