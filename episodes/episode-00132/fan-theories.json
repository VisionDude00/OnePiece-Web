    "title": "Nami's World Map Will Be Completed at Series End",
    "theory": "Many fans theorize that Nami's dream of creating a complete map of the world will only be fulfilled at the very end of One Piece, when the Straw Hats have explored every corner of the world including the final island. Episode 132's focus on Nami beginning her world map project emphasizes this dream as a long-term goal that mirrors the series' overall journey. The completion of her map would symbolize the crew's complete exploration and the achievement of all their dreams.",

    "title": "The Millennium Paper Will Prove Important",
    "theory": "Some fans theorize that the Millennium Paper Nami acquires in this filler episode could have significance beyond just being durable. Since it lasts a thousand years without fading, Nami's maps could become important historical documents that survive long after the main story, potentially helping future generations navigate the world. This would give Nami's work a legacy that extends beyond her lifetime, similar to how the Poneglyphs preserve ancient knowledge.",

    "title": "Robin's Isolation Foreshadows Water 7",
    "theory": "The review from 'Never Watched One Piece' blog notes that Robin barely speaks or acts in this episode, remaining isolated from the crew's dynamics. Some fans theorize this distance was intentional foreshadowing of her eventual departure and the Water 7/Enies Lobby arc, where Robin's inability to truly connect with the crew becomes a major plot point. Her quiet observation in filler episodes like this one may have been planting seeds for her later character arc.",
