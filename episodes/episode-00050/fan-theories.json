    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Eiichiro Oda originally intended to include the Usopp vs. Daddy Masterson storyline in the manga, but cut it to reach the Grand Line by Chapter 100. The fact that Oda designed the character for the Loguetown novel and the episode was later adapted suggests this was meant to be canon content. This would make Episode 50 'anime canon' rather than pure filler.",

The theory suggests that this filler episode, while not in the manga, provides important character development that explains Usopp's confidence in his sniping abilities and his connection to his father's legacy. The act of earning the goggles through skill rather than cowardice represents a turning point in Usopp's character arc.",

Yasopp himself chose to leave his family to pursue adventure with Shanks, while Daddy chose to stay with Carol.
