    "theoryText": "Fans theorized that Kuro's Nuki Ashi technique, which allows him to move at incredible speeds, was an early or rudimentary form of the Rokushiki technique Soru that appears later in the CP9 arc. Both techniques involve rapid leg movements to achieve superhuman speed.",

    "notes": "This theory was later confirmed by Eiichiro Oda in an SBS (question corner). Oda stated that Kuro's technique was indeed a rudimentary form of Soru, with the main difference being that Kuro couldn't control his movements as well during the high-speed motion. Oda also confirmed that Kuro's top speed is roughly equivalent to Soru."

    "theoryTitle": "Kuro Will Return as a Navy Vice Admiral",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Captain Kuro, given his exceptional intelligence (second highest IQ in East Blue) and strategic brilliance, could return later in the series as a Navy Vice Admiral. The theory suggests that after his defeat, Kuro might have leveraged his tactical mind to infiltrate the Marines, similar to how he infiltrated Kaya's household. His ability to plan years in advance and maintain a false identity would make him well-suited for a high-ranking Marine position.",

    "theoryTitle": "Kuro as a Cipher Pol Agent",
    "theoryText": "This theory proposes that Kuro, with his exceptional intelligence and proven ability to maintain deep cover for years, could return as a Cipher Pol agent. The theory draws parallels between Kuro and O'Brien from George Orwell's '1984', suggesting that Kuro's skills in infiltration, deception, and long-term planning make him an ideal candidate for intelligence work. Some versions of this theory suggest he could even head his own Cipher Pol agency.",

    "theoryTitle": "Luffy's Philosophy Clash with Kuro Establishes Series Theme",
    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized that the philosophical clash between Luffy and Kuro in this episode establishes one of the series' core themes: that genuine passion for one's dreams and way of life is more important than intelligence or planning. Kuro, despite having the second highest IQ in the East Blue and creating elaborate plans, is defeated by Luffy's straightforward, heart-driven approach. This theme continues throughout the series with various antagonists who lack genuine passion for their goals.",
