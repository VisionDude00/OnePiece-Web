    "theory": "Pearl's Fire Pearl ability is not a Devil Fruit power but rather a manifestation of intense psychological trauma combined with friction-based fire starting. His panic response when seeing blood triggers an adrenaline-fueled state where he unconsciously creates sparks through rapid shield movement, similar to how flint and steel create fire. This would explain why he's not affected by the flames and why the ability only activates under specific psychological conditions.",

    "theory": "Sanji's Black Leg Style was specifically developed by Zeff to complement his own Red Leg fighting style. The naming convention (color + leg) suggests a deliberate martial arts lineage. Zeff likely taught Sanji not just cooking but also his fighting philosophy, with Sanji's black dress shoes being the 'black leg' equivalent of Zeff's bloody 'red legs' from battle. This creates a master-student martial arts tradition centered around the Baratie.",

    "theory": "Gin's internal conflict between loyalty to Krieg and gratitude to Sanji represents a broader theme about the transformative power of kindness. The fact that Sanji feeding Gin one meal creates such a profound moral dilemma suggests that Gin has never experienced genuine compassion before. This foreshadows that Gin will ultimately choose honor over blind loyalty, potentially becoming an ally or at least refusing to kill Sanji despite orders.",
