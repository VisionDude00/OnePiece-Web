    "theoryText": "Based on Koby's incredible growth from a timid cabin boy to a Marine trained by Garp himself, many fans theorize that Koby will eventually unlock Conqueror's Haki. His unwavering determination, strong willpower (shown in Episode 69 when fighting Garp despite knowing he'll lose), and parallel to Luffy suggest he has the qualities of a 'king.' Some fans point to his eventual Observation Haki awakening at Marineford as evidence of his latent potential. The theory suggests that Koby is being set up as a future Marine Admiral who can stand equal to Luffy.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 69 features a subtle moment where Garp overhears Koby and Helmeppo discussing their friendship with Luffy but shows no reaction. Many fans theorize that Garp already knew about this connection and deliberately chose to train them anyway. This theory suggests that Garp, being Luffy's grandfather (though not revealed until Episode 314), saw training Luffy's Marine friends as a way to indirectly support his grandson while maintaining his Marine duties. The theory proposes that Garp's 'test' of their resolve was actually checking if they could maintain their Marine ideals despite befriending a pirate - a conflict Garp himself struggles with regarding Luffy.",

    "theoryText": "The Diary of Koby-Meppo arc establishes that while Koby and Helmeppo are friends with Luffy, they are committed to their Marine ideals. Fans theorize that this friendship will lead to a major conflict where Koby (and possibly Helmeppo) must face Luffy in battle, testing both their friendship and their convictions. Episode 69 shows them training specifically to become stronger, with some fans suggesting this strength is being built up for an eventual confrontation. This theory parallels the classic 'childhood friends become enemies' trope and would provide emotional weight to a future battle. The theory gained more traction after the Summit War of Marineford (Episode 488) where Koby confronted the war itself.",
