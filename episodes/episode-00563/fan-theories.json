    "summary": "Fans theorize that Hody Jones and his 'Nothing' revelation serve as Oda's commentary on real-world radicalization, inherited prejudice, and how hatred can be passed down through generations without personal experience.",
    "fullText": "The revelation that Hody answered 'Nothing' when asked what humans did to him has led many fans to interpret him as one of One Piece's most realistic and thematically significant villains. Unlike other villains with tragic backstories (like Arlong who was enslaved), Hody represents pure, baseless hatred born from environment alone. Fans note this parallels real-world radicalization where young people adopt extreme views based on stories and prejudices rather than personal experience. The irony that Hody's generation grew up relatively protected from humans (thanks to Otohime and Jinbe's efforts) yet showed even stronger hatred demonstrates how echo chambers and inherited prejudice can be more dangerous than actual conflict. Some fans argue this makes Hody Jones one of the most important villains in addressing contemporary social issues.",

    "summary": "Fans theorize that the Fish-Man District represents a failed social experiment showing how segregation and poverty create cycles of hatred that persist even when conditions improve.",
    "fullText": "The 'Nothing' revelation has led fans to analyze the Fish-Man District as a commentary on how segregated, impoverished communities can become breeding grounds for radicalization. Despite Fish-Man Island becoming safer and Otohime working toward peace, the isolated Fish-Man District continued to perpetuate hatred because it was cut off from positive change. Hody and his generation grew up in an echo chamber where stories of human cruelty were told without context or counter-narratives. This theory suggests Oda is commenting on how structural inequality and segregation create environments where hatred becomes self-sustaining, even disconnected from actual threats. The New Fish-Man Pirates fear their hatred will fade because hatred has become their identity - without an enemy, they have no purpose.",

    "fullText": "When Neptune says 'if Noah hits the island, it would be just as it was written,' fans theorize this connects to Joy Boy's promise and the eventual need to bring Fish-Men to the surface world. The theory suggests that the cycle of hatred represented by Hody can only truly end when Fish-Men and humans live together on the surface, eliminating the physical and social barriers that enable segregation and inherited prejudice. Noah crashing would destroy Fish-Man Island, forcing its inhabitants to integrate with the surface world - fulfilling an ancient prophecy about ending isolation. This connects the personal revelation about Hody (hatred from segregation) with the larger geopolitical solution (integration via Noah). Some fans predict this will happen at the series' end, with Luffy helping to bring Fish-Man Island to the surface using Noah as originally intended.",
