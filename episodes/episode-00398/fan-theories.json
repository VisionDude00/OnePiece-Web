    "summary": "Fans recognize that Doflamingo's casual mention of 'SMILEs' in Episode 398 is one of the most impressive examples of Eiichiro Oda's long-term planning, as SMILEs don't appear or get mentioned again for over 200 episodes.",
    "fullText": "In Episode 398, when Disco calls Doflamingo for help regarding the auction house attack, Doflamingo responds by saying 'Slavery is passé. SMILEs are the future.' This single line, easily overlooked at the time, is now recognized as incredible foreshadowing. SMILEs (artificial Devil Fruits) don't appear physically or get mentioned again until Episode 615, over 200 episodes later. The SMILE factory and Doflamingo's business with Kaido become central to the Punk Hazard, Dressrosa, and Wano arcs. This demonstrates Oda's meticulous planning and ability to plant seeds for storylines that won't pay off for years. The fact that Doflamingo was already thinking about and working on SMILEs during the Sabaody arc shows how far ahead the story was planned.",

    "summary": "The technique Rayleigh uses to remove Camie's explosive collar in Episode 398 is the same advanced Armament Haki technique that Luffy learns and uses in Wano to remove explosive collars.",
    "fullText": "When Rayleigh removes Camie's explosive slave collar in Episode 398, he's using an advanced Armament Haki technique that allows him to destroy the collar from the inside without triggering the explosion. This moment becomes a direct callback in the Wano arc when Luffy, after learning advanced Armament Haki, uses the exact same technique to remove explosive collars from himself and Hyougoro in Udon prison. Luffy even explicitly states that he's doing what he saw Rayleigh do on Sabaody. This shows that Rayleigh's demonstration wasn't just a cool moment - it was planting the seed for an important technique Luffy would later master. It also demonstrates Oda's planning, as this callback happens over 500 episodes later.",

    "summary": "Episode 398's introduction of Haki by name marks a fundamental shift in One Piece's power system, moving beyond just Devil Fruits to include willpower-based abilities.",
    "fullText": "Episode 398 is the first time the word 'Haki' is spoken in the One Piece anime when Hatchan identifies Rayleigh's power. While some fans had speculated about mysterious powers shown earlier in the series (like Shanks scaring off the Sea King, or Mantra in Skypiea), this episode officially establishes Haki as a distinct power system. This introduction was deliberate - Rayleigh demonstrates both Conqueror's Haki (knocking out the auction house) and advanced Armament Haki (removing the collar), showing viewers that there's a whole new level of power beyond Devil Fruits. This sets up the foundation for the two-year training arc where Luffy learns Haki, and for countless future battles where Haki becomes essential. The timing of this introduction - right before the crew's separation and time skip - is perfect storytelling, as it gives narrative justification for why Luffy needs to train rather than just getting stronger through more fights.",
