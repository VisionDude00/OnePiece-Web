    "title": "Ivankov's Makeup as Strategic Armor",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Ivankov's thick makeup and elaborate appearance isn't just for aesthetic purposes, but represents a deliberate strategic choice. The mascara protecting him from Magellan's poison in episode 448 suggests that Ivankov has developed his appearance as a form of non-Devil Fruit defense. This could mean that other aspects of his appearance (wigs, clothing, accessories) might serve similar protective or tactical purposes that we haven't seen yet.",

    "title": "Revolutionary Army's Knowledge of Impel Down Layout",
    "theoryText": "The efficiency with which Ivankov and Inazuma coordinate the escape strategy (cutting stairs, choosing where to make stands) suggests the Revolutionary Army had detailed intelligence about Impel Down's structure before Ivankov was imprisoned. This raises questions about whether Ivankov's imprisonment was partially intentional, or if the Revolutionary Army had planted information sources within the prison system. The strategic placement of Newkama Land on Level 5.5 further supports this theory.",
