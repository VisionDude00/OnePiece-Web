    "summary": "The X-mark beneath the bandages established in Episode 112 and used in the farewell scene (Episode 130) may foreshadow Vivi's eventual return to the Straw Hat crew in the future.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that the emotional significance of the X-mark scene, where the Straw Hats silently show Vivi they will always be friends, foreshadows her eventual return to actively sailing with them. The permanent nature of the mark (tattooed by some crew members later) and Vivi's ongoing connection to the crew suggests she may rejoin during the Final War or other critical endgame events. Some point to recent manga developments showing Vivi in danger as evidence this theory may come true.",

    "summary": "Mr. 2 revealing that Crocodile knew about the Straw Hats' arm bandage system suggests Baroque Works had extensive surveillance capabilities throughout Arabasta that went beyond what was explicitly shown.",
    "fullText": "When Mr. 2 reveals that Crocodile informed all elite Baroque Works agents about the X-mark bandage system, it raises questions about how he obtained this information. Some fans theorize that Baroque Works had surveillance Den Den Mushi or informants watching the Straw Hats more closely than revealed. Others suggest this demonstrates Crocodile's strategic genius in anticipating the crew's countermeasures. This could explain how Baroque Works seemed to always be one step ahead during the arc.",

    "fullText": "Karoo's act of shielding Vivi from being trampled by thousands of soldiers demonstrates loyalty beyond normal animal behavior. Some fans theorize that Super Spot-Billed Ducks may have been selectively bred or naturally evolved to have enhanced loyalty instincts, making them perfect companions for the Arabasta royal family. This would explain why they serve as the kingdom's primary military cavalry and why Karoo risks his life so readily for Vivi. The Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops' coordinated rescue of Vivi from Mr. 2 later in the arc supports this theory of species-wide protective instincts.",
