    "theory": "This theory proposes that Fisher Tiger was the previous user of the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Sun God Nika devil fruit before Luffy. The evidence includes: (1) Fisher Tiger died approximately 12 years before the current timeline, which is around when Luffy ate his Devil Fruit, suggesting the fruit could have reincarnated; (2) Tiger freed slaves from Mary Geoise just like the legendary Sun God Nika, and his crew was named the 'Sun Pirates' after the sun symbol; (3) Tiger's actions and legacy align with the Nika mythology of liberation and freedom.",

    "theory": "After being freed by Fisher Tiger and witnessing his death (indirectly), Koala will grow up to become a significant force against the World Government. Tiger hoped she could help break the cycle of hatred, and her unique perspective as both a former slave and someone who was shown kindness by fish-men will make her instrumental in the final conflict. This theory gained traction after episode 543 aired.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that the World Government specifically orchestrated the situation on Foolshout Island to eliminate Fisher Tiger. They suggest the government told the villagers exactly what to do - allow Koala to be returned but then betray Tiger's location - knowing that this would lead to Tiger's death while appearing to be the villagers' choice. This would explain why the Marines were so well-prepared and why Rear Admiral Strawberry was specifically assigned.",
