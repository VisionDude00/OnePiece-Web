## Synopsis

The Sun Pirates return young Koala to her hometown on Foolshout Island, where she is emotionally reunited with her mother Muti. After a heartfelt goodbye, Fisher Tiger is betrayed by the villagers who contact the Marines in exchange for them not returning Koala to the Celestial Dragons.

Ambushed by Rear Admiral Strawberry and a Marine fleet, Tiger is mortally wounded. Despite Aladine's attempts to save him with a blood transfusion, Tiger refuses human blood, revealing his inability to overcome the hatred stemming from his past enslavement.

In his final moments, Tiger reveals the truth he had hidden - that he was once a slave of the Celestial Dragons. He asks his crew not to pass on their hatred to the next generation, expressing hope that children like Koala can create a better future. Fisher Tiger dies from blood loss, leaving the Sun Pirates to mourn their beloved captain.
