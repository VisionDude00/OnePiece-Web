## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- Could not locate a full transcript or script for line-by-line analysis
- Had to rely on episode summaries, wiki information, and fan reviews
- Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and plot progression

### Timestamp Estimation
Since I didn't have access to the actual episode video, timestamps were estimated as follows:
- Opening/recap: ~0:00-2:00
- First act: ~2:00-7:00
- Second act: ~7:00-12:00
- Third act: ~12:00-17:00
- Climax: ~17:00-21:00
- Preview: ~21:00-22:00

These should be verified against the actual episode for accuracy.
