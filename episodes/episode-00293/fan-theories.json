    "theory": "The fight between Nami and Kalifa is considered one of the most lopsided in One Piece, with fans theorizing that Oda intentionally gave Nami the weakest CP9 member because there was genuinely no way Nami could defeat a properly-powered CP9 agent at her current strength level. This represents a narrative concession to allow Nami to contribute meaningfully to Robin's rescue.",
