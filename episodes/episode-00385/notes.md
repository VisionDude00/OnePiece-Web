# Research Notes for Episode 385

## Episode Overview
Episode 385, "Arriving at Halfway Through the Grand Line! The Red Line," marks the beginning of the highly acclaimed Sabaody Archipelago Arc. This episode serves as a transition from the Thriller Bark Arc to one of the most pivotal arcs in One Piece.

## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
- **Primary Wiki**: One Piece Fandom Wiki (highly detailed episode and character pages)
- **Voice Actor Database**: Behind The Voice Actors (for cast verification)
- **Video Content**: Multiple reaction videos on Bilibili and Patreon
- **Reviews**: Hogan Reviews arc review, various fan discussions
- **Manga References**: Chapter 490 information for comparison

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Limited Script Access**: Could not find a complete, detailed transcript of Episode 385. Most sources provided plot summaries rather than line-by-line dialogue, which made it challenging to create precise timestamp-based events. Timestamps provided are estimated based on typical episode pacing.

2. **Exact Timestamp Accuracy**: Without access to the actual episode video during research, timestamps are approximations based on typical One Piece episode structure (opening ~2 minutes, recap/setup early, main action mid-episode, etc.).

3. **Reddit Discussion Gap**: Despite searching, no specific Reddit discussion threads for Episode 385 were found. The episode aired in 2009, and older episode discussions may not have been well-preserved or indexed.

4. **Limited First-Hand Reviews**: Most reaction content found was from reactors who combined episodes 385-386, treating them as a unit rather than reviewing Episode 385 specifically.
