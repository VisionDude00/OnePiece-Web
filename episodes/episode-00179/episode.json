      "description": "Enel explains to the gathered survivors that his game began with numerous participants including himself, and according to his calculations, exactly five people should remain after three hours. However, he reveals that he's aware of Nami's presence, meaning there are currently six survivors instead of his predicted five.",
      "significance": "Reveals the mathematical precision of Enel's deadly game and his god-like omniscience through Mantra (Observation Haki). The discrepancy of six survivors instead of five creates tension about who will be eliminated.",
