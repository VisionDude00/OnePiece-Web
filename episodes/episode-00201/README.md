## Cultural Impact

### The Condoriano Meme
This episode continues one of One Piece's most beloved memes. Shepherd's continued misidentification as "Condoriano" has become a lasting joke in the fandom, with fans creating the "Con D. Oriano" meme claiming he's a secret member of the Will of D and the hidden 10th Straw Hat.

### G-8 Arc Quality
Episode 201 is part of the G-8 Arc (Episodes 196-206), widely considered the best filler arc in One Piece. Many fans wish this arc were canon due to its:
- Excellent character writing (Vice Admiral Jonathan)
- Strategic battles over raw power
- Perfect blend of comedy and action
- Memorable moments like Condoriano

## Themes

1. **Loyalty and Trust** - Crew rescues each other; Dr. Kobato helps despite being an enemy
2. **Strategic Warfare vs. Direct Action** - Jonathan's tactics vs. Luffy's straightforward approach
3. **Comedy in Crisis** - Maintains humor through Condoriano gag and exaggerated Special Forces

2. **Timestamp Estimation** - Without access to the full episode or detailed script, timestamps were estimated based on typical episode structure and event ordering from summaries.

3. **Filler Arc Documentation** - Filler episodes have less detailed documentation than canon episodes, requiring more extensive cross-referencing of sources.

4. **Voice Actor Information** - Some voice actors for minor G-8 characters were difficult to confirm; focused on main characters with verified credits.
