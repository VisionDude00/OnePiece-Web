    "theory": "The revelation that the Donquixote family enslaved the Tontatta dwarves 900 years ago suggests that the Donquixote family was one of the 20 kingdoms that formed the World Government during the Void Century. This explains Doflamingo's connection to the Celestial Dragons and hints that the original King Donquixote was among those who committed atrocities during the Void Century to establish the current world order.",

    "theory": "Both Dressrosa and Alabasta have histories dating back to the Void Century (900 years ago). The Nefertari family refused to become Celestial Dragons while the Donquixote family became one of the 20 ruling families. Both kingdoms have underground elements (the Tontatta Kingdom and the Poneglyph chamber), and both involve rebellions against corrupt leadership. This parallel suggests Oda is exploring different outcomes when ancient kingdoms interact with the World Government's formation.",

    "theory": "The Tontatta dwarves' 900-year conflict with the Donquixote family suggests they may have been allied with or part of the Ancient Kingdom that opposed the 20 kingdoms during the Void Century. Their enslavement by the Donquixote family could represent the World Government's systematic oppression of those who supported the Ancient Kingdom. Their incredible strength despite small size and their possession of ancient knowledge might connect them to the lost civilization.",

This episode marks the beginning of Usopp's most significant character development arc.",
