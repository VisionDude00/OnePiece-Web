    "theoryTitle": "The Significance of Zoro's Flying Slash Techniques",
    "theoryText": "The introduction of the 36 Pound Cannon marks the beginning of Zoro's development of ranged attacks. Fans theorize that this technique and its philosophy (based on the 36 earthly desires from Buddhist teachings) represent Zoro's spiritual growth as a swordsman. The technique later evolves into the 72 Pound Cannon and 108 Pound Cannon, suggesting a progression in Zoro's mastery of his sword style. Some fans believe this progression mirrors Zoro's journey toward becoming the world's greatest swordsman, with each numbered technique representing a milestone in his understanding of the sword.",

    "theoryTitle": "Enel's Overconfidence and Foreshadowing",
    "theoryText": "Enel's easy defeat of Sanji and Usopp in Episode 170 demonstrates his overwhelming power, but fans theorize that this also establishes his fatal flaw: overconfidence. His declaration that they are 'part of the game now' and his casual approach to eliminating opponents foreshadows his eventual defeat by Luffy. The theory suggests that Enel's god complex, reinforced by these easy victories, will make him underestimate Luffy's unique ability to counter his lightning powers with rubber. This episode plants the seeds for Enel's ultimate downfall by showing both his immense power and his arrogance.",
