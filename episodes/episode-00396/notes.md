# Research Notes for Episode 396

## Episode Overview
Episode 396 "The Fist Explodes! Destroy the Auction" is one of the most iconic and highly-rated episodes in One Piece history, with a 9.6 IMDb rating making it the highest-rated episode as of December 2023.

## Research Process

### Sources Found
- Successfully located comprehensive information from One Piece Wiki (Fandom)
- Found manga chapter 502 details which this episode adapts
- Located multiple fan reaction videos on Bilibili
- Found analytical articles from Collider, Screen Rant, Fiction Horizon, and CBR

### Challenges Encountered
1. **No Full Episode Transcript Available**: Could not locate a complete line-by-line transcript of the episode. Had to rely on plot summaries and wiki descriptions for detailed scene breakdowns.

2. **Limited Timestamp Information**: Exact timestamps for events were estimated based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions. The timestamps provided (04:15, 06:30, etc.) are approximations rather than confirmed times.

3. **Voice Actor Information**: While I found confirmation for main cast members, some supporting character voice actors (particularly for auction house crowd members and minor nobles) could not be verified.

4. **Reddit Discussion Threads**: Despite searching, I could not locate specific Reddit discussion threads dedicated to episode 396. Found general analysis and theory posts but no episode-specific discussion thread.

5. **Podcast Coverage**: Could not find specific podcast episodes from major One Piece podcasts (The One Piece Podcast, Grand Line Review, etc.) that covered episode 396 specifically, though these podcasters likely discussed it as part of arc coverage.
