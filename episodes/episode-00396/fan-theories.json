    "description": "After witnessing Luffy punch Saint Charlos at the auction house, Bartholomew Kuma developed high hopes that Luffy could become a hero capable of saving the world. This moment was pivotal in Kuma's decision-making process regarding his treatment of the Straw Hats, ultimately leading him to protect the Thousand Sunny for two years and sacrifice himself for their sake. Chapter 1102 revealed that Kuma started believing in Luffy's potential specifically after the Celestial Dragon punch.",

    "theory": "The Kuma-Luffy Punch Parallel Theory",
    "description": "Chapter 1103 appears to deliberately parallel Kuma's stance when punching Saint Saturn with Luffy's iconic punch of Saint Charlos in episode 396. The similarities in posture and framing suggest Oda is creating a thematic callback, showing how Kuma learned from Luffy's defiance and courage. This would represent the ultimate catharsis for Kuma's suffering at the hands of the Celestial Dragons, with him finally taking the same stand that inspired him.",

Without this forced separation triggered by the punch, the crew would not have undergone the individual training that made them strong enough for post-timeskip challenges. Luffy's moral choice, while seemingly reckless, ultimately saved the crew by forcing them to grow.",

The act demonstrated that the World Nobles are not untouchable divine beings but humans who can be held accountable for their actions.
