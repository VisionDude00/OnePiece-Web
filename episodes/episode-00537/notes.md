  - One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - comprehensive episode summary
  - Crunchyroll official streaming - episode description
  - Multiple blog reviews and recaps

## Observations & Analysis

### Character Development
- **Shirahoshi:** Shows significant growth by rejecting Vander Decken despite fear

### Thematic Elements
1. **Obsession vs. Love:** The episode explores the difference between genuine affection and possessive obsession
2. **Courage:** Shirahoshi finds courage to stand up for herself
3. **Prejudice:** Fish-men locals immediately assume the worst of human pirates

### Foreshadowing
- Energy Steroids are established as a major threat (will pay off in later episodes)
- Shirahoshi's courage will continue to develop throughout the arc
- The Sea Forest meeting will reveal crucial backstory

## Challenges & Limitations

1. **No Episode Script:** Could not locate a complete transcript, relied on summaries
2. **Timestamp Accuracy:** Timestamps are estimates based on episode flow and typical pacing
