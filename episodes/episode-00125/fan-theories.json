    "theory": "The theory suggests that Eiichiro Oda originally planned for Pell to die in the explosion but changed his mind due to sensitivity around the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Since the episode aired in Japan on September 8, 2002, approximately one year after 9/11, and featured a character performing a suicide bombing on a tower, Oda and his editors may have felt it was in poor taste to keep the death. This led to Pell's survival being revealed in Episode 130.",

      "Episode 125 aired September 8, 2002, about a year after the 9/11 attacks",
      "The scene involves a character carrying a bomb to sacrifice themselves",

      "One Piece has a pattern of characters surviving seemingly fatal situations that predates this arc",
      "The manga chapters were written before 9/11, so the story was already set",

    "theory": "Pell survived the explosion because Zoan-type Devil Fruit users have enhanced durability and toughness. The theory suggests that Pell threw the bomb upward to get it as high as possible while simultaneously diving downward, catching only the edge of the blast rather than taking it at point-blank range. His Zoan transformation provided enough enhanced durability to survive the injuries.",

      "Zoan users are shown throughout the series to have enhanced physical durability",
      "Pell could have released the bomb and dove away at the last moment",
