    "theoryText": "The Rainbow Mist arc introduces time displacement where the Pumpkin Pirates remain young for 50 years, yet in the Wano Country Arc, the Straw Hats express surprise at time travel. This creates a continuity problem - either the crew forgot about the Rainbow Mist experience, or Oda didn't consider this filler arc when writing Wano.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Rainbow Mist phenomenon could be the result of a dormant or ancient Devil Fruit power affecting the area around Ruluka Island, rather than being a purely natural phenomenon. This would explain its supernatural time-displacement properties and why it appears periodically in the same location.",
