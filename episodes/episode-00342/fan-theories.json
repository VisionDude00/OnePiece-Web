    "theory": "Ryuma, being animated by Brook's shadow, symbolically represents Brook's depression and inability to move forward. Brook must literally fight his own shadow (his depression) to regain his ability to see the light, making his eventual confrontation with Ryuma a battle against his inner demons.",

    "title": "Hogback's True Motivation",
    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Hogback's obsession with resurrecting Cindry goes beyond simple romantic love. His actions suggest he may have been involved in or responsible for her death, and his zombie experiments are driven by guilt rather than love. This would explain why he's so fixated on keeping her zombie form despite her clear rejection of him.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that the reason Negative Hollows work even on strong-willed characters like Luffy and Zoro is because they attack a different aspect of willpower than Conqueror's Haki. While Conqueror's Haki is about imposing your will on others, Negative Hollows attack one's will from within, turning their own mental strength against them. This explains why naturally negative people like Usopp are immune - they have no internal strength for the ability to corrupt.",
