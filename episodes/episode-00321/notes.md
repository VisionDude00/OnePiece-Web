## Research Challenges & Notes

### Challenges Encountered
- Limited specific fan theory discussions about Episode 321 itself
- Most theories focus on broader story arcs rather than individual episodes
- Reaction videos for this episode are scattered across platforms
- Some older forum discussions (2006-2007) are archived and hard to access

### Additional Observations
- This episode serves as crucial transition between Enies Lobby intensity and lighter Post-Enies Lobby moments
- The comedic underwear chase balances emotional weight of receiving new ship
- Episode demonstrates One Piece's ability to blend humor with meaningful character development
- Franky's recruitment method (being forced for his own good) is unique among Straw Hat recruitment stories
