    "theoryText": "The number 325 can be pronounced as San (3) Ni (2) Go (5) in Japanese, which some fans believe is a deliberate reference to the Thousand Sunny, the second ship for the Straw Hat Pirates following the Going Merry. This numerological wordplay is common in One Piece.",

    "theoryText": "The chaotic underwear chase in Episode 321 symbolizes Franky's internal struggle between his loyalty to his family and his desire for freedom. By stealing his swim briefs, the Franky Family literally strips away his ability to stay, forcing him to accept the freedom he secretly desires. This mirrors how the Straw Hats represent freedom throughout the series, and Franky's recruitment had to involve him being 'forced' to be free because he would never choose to leave his family voluntarily.",

    "theoryText": "Franky's message that 'The King of Pirates should sail a ship graced by the King of Beasts' (the lion figurehead) is believed by some fans to foreshadow Luffy's eventual status as Pirate King. The lion, known as the King of Beasts, symbolizes royalty, strength, and leadership - all qualities Luffy embodies. Some fans theorize this also connects to the Sun God Nika mythology revealed later in the series, as lions are often associated with the sun in various cultures.",
