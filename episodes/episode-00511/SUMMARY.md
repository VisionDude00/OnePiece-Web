## Researcher Notes

This episode represents a masterclass in symbolic storytelling and strategic communication. Rayleigh's plan to use Luffy's return to Marineford for multiple purposes - mourning, messaging, and declaration - showcases Oda's ability to pack layers of meaning into a single sequence.

The contrast between Luffy's solemn ceremony and the chaos the Supernovas face in the New World effectively sets up the two-year timeskip as a necessary preparation rather than a delay. Each Supernova scene emphasizes that the New World is not just harder - it's fundamentally different in its dangers.

The multi-layered interpretation of the message (Marines seeing war declaration, pirates seeing era change, crew seeing training plan) is particularly brilliant and deserves the "CRITICAL" severity rating given to the Ox Bell event.

Voice actor note: This episode's significance is amplified by being one of the last performances by Takkō Ishimori as Sengoku before his passing, adding real-world poignancy to Sengoku's retirement storyline.
