  "description": "Luffy, Jinbe, and Rayleigh make an unexpected return to Marineford. After circling the island in a stolen Marine ship, Luffy enters the plaza alone, rings the Ox Bell sixteen times, and drops flowers into the largest battle crater to pay respects to the fallen. This ceremonial act carries a hidden message for his scattered crew members while the world interprets it as a declaration of a new era. Meanwhile, Sengoku steps down and nominates Aokiji as his successor, Koby awakens Observation Haki, and various pirate crews react to Luffy's bold statement as they enter the New World.",
