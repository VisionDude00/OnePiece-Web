## Research Limitations

1. **No Episode Script Access**: Could not find a complete transcript or script for Episode 118. Had to rely on episode summaries and wiki information.

2. **Limited Video Access**: Could not watch the actual episode to verify exact timestamps, so all timestamps are estimated.

3. **Voice Actor Completeness**: Could not find complete voice actor lists for all characters (e.g., Miss Doublefinger's VAs unknown).

4. **External Media**: Limited reaction/analysis content specifically for Episode 118 as individual episode; most content covers the arc as a whole.

## Quality Assurance Notes

✓ All events have severity ratings
✓ Sources documented for all major claims
✓ Character IDs follow kebab-case convention
✓ Episode relationships documented (setup/payoff)
✓ Incremental approach maintained (only Episode 118 data)
✓ No placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, etc.)
✓ JSON files validated for syntax

## Questions/Uncertainties

1. **Exact Timestamps**: Without episode access, timestamps are approximations based on typical episode structure.

2. **Missing Voice Actors**: Could not find Japanese/English voice actors for Miss Doublefinger (Zala) and Mr. 1 (Daz Bones).

3. **Episode Viewership Metrics**: Limited data on episode popularity metrics beyond the Japanese TV rating.

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. Obtain access to episode video for exact timestamp verification
2. Cross-reference with Japanese sources for complete voice actor credits
3. Search Japanese-language fan sites for additional external media
4. Review episode discussion threads on older forums (2002-2010 era)

Episode 118 is well-documented with strong source material available. The episode's significance to the overall One Piece narrative is clear and well-established. The major limitation is the lack of detailed episode script/transcript access, but episode summaries and manga source material provide sufficient information for comprehensive documentation.
