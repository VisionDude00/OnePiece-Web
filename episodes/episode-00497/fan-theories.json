    "theoryText": "Some fans believe that Sabo was created as a retcon to justify his introduction in Chapter 583 and Episode 494. Since Sabo had never been mentioned at all during the series before the Post-War Arc, many fans viewed the flashback to Luffy's childhood as a retroactive addition to fit Sabo into his past, rather than a character who had been planned from the beginning.",

    "title": "Did Ace Know Sabo Was Alive?",
    "theoryText": "There's speculation among fans about whether Ace knew Sabo was alive before his death. Some fans point to Ace's final words that he 'lived a life with no regrets' as potential evidence that he may have known. However, the prevalent theory is that Ace died believing Sabo was dead, never learning that his brother had survived and joined the Revolutionary Army. The tragedy is compounded by the fact that Ace and Garp never caught wind of Sabo's survival despite his rising bounty and prominent role in global affairs.",

The hideout being designed as a ship represents each brother will eventually set sail on their own journey - Ace with the Whitebeard Pirates, Sabo with the Revolutionary Army, and Luffy with the Straw Hat Pirates. The fact that they built it together shows their bond will always connect them even when physically apart.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Dadan's character arc in the flashback episodes, particularly her maternal development shown in Episode 497, intentionally parallels other 'rough exterior, kind heart' characters in One Piece like Zeff and Bellemere. The theory suggests Oda uses these reluctant parent figures to explore themes of found family and how love can develop in unexpected circumstances, with Dadan representing the most extreme case - a bandit forced to raise the grandson of her enemy who comes to genuinely love the child.",
