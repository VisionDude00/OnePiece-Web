    "theory": "Chapter 1099 revealed that Kuma visited many of the islands he sent the Straw Hats to during the time-skip, including Torino Kingdom, while searching for a cure for Bonney's disease. This suggests that Kuma's choice of where to send each crew member wasn't random but carefully considered based on his knowledge of each island and each crew member's needs. The theory proposes that Kuma, believing Luffy resembled Nika and would save the world, intentionally sent each Straw Hat to locations that would help them grow stronger and prepare for the New World.",
