## Challenges and Blockers

### Script/Transcript Access
**Issue:** Could not locate a complete episode script or transcript for Episode 428.

**Impact:**
- Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and event sequences
- Exact dialogue quotes are limited to what was available in wiki summaries
- Could not verify precise timing of events

**Mitigation:**
- Used multiple wiki sources and episode summaries for cross-reference
- Estimated timestamps based on logical event progression
- Documented only quotes that appeared in reliable sources

### Fan Theories
**Issue:** No significant fan theories found specifically for Episode 428.

**Reasoning:**
- This is a filler arc that doesn't affect main story canon
- Episode aired over 15 years ago with limited ongoing discussion
- Filler content typically generates less fan theory engagement
- Most fan discussion focuses on canon manga events

**Result:** Created empty fan-theories.json file

### Voice Actor Information
**Issue:** Could not find complete voice actor credits for all supporting characters (Yoko, Boss, other Amigo Pirates members).

**Impact:**
- Some character entries have null values for voice actors
- Only confirmed main Straw Hat crew and primary antagonists (Largo, Corto)

## Notable Findings

### Anime-Only Content
- **Entire arc is non-canon:** Episodes 426-429 were created specifically to promote One Piece Film: Strong World
- **Ami Ami no Mi is anime-only:** This Devil Fruit never appears in the manga
- **Characters are filler:** Largo, Corto, Boss, Yoko, and other Little East Blue residents are exclusive to these episodes

### Connection to Strong World
- Arc serves as prologue introducing Shiki as the film's antagonist
- Boss was created by Dr. Indigo as part of Shiki's mutant animal army
- Amigo Pirates were attempting to join Shiki's fleet
- Arc was "jammed into" the Impel Down arc timeline for promotional purposes

### Production Quality
- TV rating: 12.2% (Ranked #3 in timeslot)
- Standard animation quality
- Opening: "Kaze wo Sagashite" (Episodes 426-458)
- Ending: "Free Will" (Episodes 425-453)

### Character Development Highlights
**Largo:**
- Unique Mexican mariachi aesthetic
- Uses Spanish terms ("amor," "señor," "señorita")
- Distinctive laugh: "shik-shik-shik" (sounds like sobbing)
- Takes siestas at inopportune moments
- Anime-only Devil Fruit user with versatile abilities

**Boss:**
- Giant beetle with monthly molting cycle
- Can emit fire from horn
- Retains Marine insignia painted by Yoko through molts
- Originally created for world destruction but escaped
- Protective of Little East Blue villagers

**Yoko:**
- Orphan whose Marine father died fighting pirates
- Initially harbors prejudice against all pirates
- Uses masculine pronoun "ore"
- Bites people who irritate her
- Character arc involves overcoming prejudice through Straw Hats' actions
