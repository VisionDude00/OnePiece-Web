    "theoryText": "Conqueror's Haki (CoC) is not exclusively for the 'chosen ones' but is actually latent within EVERYONE. It represents a manifestation of someone's spirit that awakens when willpower reaches sufficient conviction and determination. Unlike other abilities, it cannot be trained directly but only controlled, since one cannot directly train resolve - it manifests through achieving goals. Advanced CoC requires understanding 'haki flow,' a technique that must be learned from masters. The theory also suggests there are types of CoC: most users affect their environment (environmental conquest) while characters like Zoro display a unique variant affecting only themselves, manifesting physical limbs (self-conquest). This reframes CoC from predetermined destiny to achievable spiritual development through demonstrated willpower.",

This pattern differs from other Conqueror's Haki users who typically use it to intimidate or dominate opponents. Luffy's 'kingly' quality comes from his desire to protect and free others rather than rule over them.
