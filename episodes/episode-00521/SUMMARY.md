**Air Date:** October 30, 2011 (Japan) | October 29, 2011 (US Simulcast)
**Arc:** Return to Sabaody
**Saga:** Fish-Man Island Saga

## Episode Summary

After two years of separation following the events at Sabaody Archipelago, the Straw Hat Pirates reunite at their home archipelago, now stronger than ever. This episode serves as a dramatic demonstration of the crew's growth, particularly focusing on Luffy's newfound mastery of Haki and the Monster Trio's ability to easily defeat enemies that were once overwhelming threats.

## Major Plot Points

1. **Rayleigh Completes Ship Coating**: At Grove 17, Rayleigh meets with the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny, having completed the ship coating necessary for their journey to Fish-Man Island. He teaches Nami how to operate the coated vessel.

2. **Fake Straw Hats Exposed**: At Grove 46, Marines attack the assembled pirates who answered the Fake Straw Hat Crew's recruitment call. Sentomaru arrives with Pacifistas and exposes the impostor Luffy as Demaro Black, a low-ranking pirate with only a 26 million berry bounty.

3. **Caribou's Devil Fruit Debut**: During the battle, Caribou reveals he possesses the Numa Numa no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into swamp/mud. This is the first new Devil Fruit and first Logia revealed after the timeskip.

4. **Luffy's Power Demonstration**: The real Luffy's identity is revealed, and he demonstrates his post-timeskip strength by activating Gear Second combined with Armament Haki. With a single Haki-enhanced Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol, he completely destroys Pacifista PX-5—a feat that would have been impossible two years ago.

5. **Zoro and Sanji's Growth**: Luffy encounters Zoro and Sanji, and together they face Pacifista PX-7. Zoro and Sanji team up to easily destroy the Pacifista, further demonstrating the crew's dramatic power increase.

6. **Gratitude and Determination**: As the Monster Trio runs toward the Thousand Sunny, Luffy stops to thank Rayleigh for his training and loudly declares he will become the Pirate King, with Rayleigh smiling in response.
