    "title": "Zoro vs Kizaru Rematch Theory",
    "summary": "Fans theorize that Zoro will eventually get a rematch against Admiral Kizaru, mirroring how Rayleigh (the previous generation's number 2) fought Kizaru at Sabaody.",
    "fullText": "Many fans believe that the Sabaody Archipelago arc established a connection between Zoro and Kizaru that needs to be resolved. Kizaru almost killed Zoro in Sabaody before Rayleigh intervened, creating what fans see as a 'passing of the torch' moment from Rayleigh to Zoro with Kizaru as their common enemy. The theory suggests that just as Rayleigh (Roger's right-hand man) fought Kizaru to protect the Straw Hats, Zoro (Luffy's right-hand man) will eventually defeat Kizaru to prove his growth. Supporters point to the narrative parallel and Kizaru's skill as a swordsman (matching Rayleigh in swordsmanship) making him a fitting opponent for Zoro. During the Egghead arc, many fans predicted this rematch would occur, though Luffy ended up facing Kizaru instead.",

    "summary": "Fans theorized that Sentomaru would eventually turn against the World Government due to his loyalty to Vegapunk over the Marines.",
    "fullText": "From his first appearance, fans noted that Sentomaru's primary loyalty was to Dr. Vegapunk rather than the World Government or Marines. His introduction in episode 403 emphasized his role as Vegapunk's bodyguard above all else. This led many to theorize that if the World Government ever threatened or betrayed Vegapunk, Sentomaru would side with his mentor over his Marine superiors. This theory proved accurate during the Egghead arc when Sentomaru defied orders and helped Vegapunk and the Straw Hats escape from the World Government.",

    "fullText": "When the Pacifistas were revealed in the Sabaody Archipelago arc, many fans speculated that this was just the first generation of cyborg technology from Dr. Vegapunk. The fact that they were modeled after Bartholomew Kuma suggested that Vegapunk could create similar weapons based on other powerful individuals. This theory was eventually confirmed with the introduction of the Seraphim - advanced child-like cyborgs based on the former Warlords - which represent a much more advanced version of the Pacifista technology first seen in episode 403.",
