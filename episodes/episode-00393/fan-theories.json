    "summary": "Bonney's quick recognition of the danger when Zoro nearly attacked Saint Charlos may stem from her own connection to the Celestial Dragons through her birth father.",
    "fullText": "During Episode 393, Jewelry Bonney demonstrates intimate knowledge of the Admiral dispatch protocol when she saves Zoro from attacking Saint Charlos. Fans have theorized that her quick thinking and deep understanding of Celestial Dragon protection protocols may be connected to revelations about her heritage. Later manga chapters reveal that Bonney's birth father is implied to be a Celestial Dragon who kidnapped her mother Ginny to take as his eighth wife, meaning Bonney has Celestial Dragon ancestry. This background would explain why she understood the severe consequences of attacking a World Noble better than most pirates, as she may have firsthand experience with the power structures protecting them. Her intervention wasn't just about preventing an Admiral dispatch - it may have been personal, knowing the cruelty of the Celestial Dragons from her own traumatic past.",

    "summary": "The automatic Admiral dispatch when a Celestial Dragon is harmed serves as the World Government's ultimate deterrent, ensuring absolute protection for the descendants of the founders even at the cost of massive military resources.",
    "fullText": "Episode 393 reveals the Admiral dispatch protocol - if anyone harms a World Noble, the World Government automatically dispatches a Marine Admiral to hunt down and eliminate the perpetrator. This system has led fans to theorize about the true purpose of this extreme response. Rather than just protecting individuals, the protocol may be the World Government's way of maintaining the fiction of Celestial Dragons as 'gods.' By ensuring swift and overwhelming retaliation for any slight against them, the government prevents anyone from testing whether the Celestial Dragons are truly untouchable. The protocol also serves as a deterrent that keeps even powerful pirates in line - as seen when Jewelry Bonney warns Zoro that attacking Saint Charlos would have doomed everyone on the island. The theory suggests this is why slavery and the auction house can operate openly on Sabaody - the Admiral dispatch protocol creates a bubble of absolute power where Celestial Dragons and their preferred institutions are untouchable.",

    "fullText": "Episode 393 deliberately structures Camie's story to maximize emotional impact and thematic resonance. She fulfills her childhood dream of riding the ferris wheel at Sabaody Park - a dream specifically highlighted as being common among Fish-Men and Merfolk who face discrimination elsewhere. The ferris wheel represents freedom, joy, and a rare moment of equality. Then, immediately after this moment of pure happiness, she is kidnapped by the Hound Pets to be sold into slavery. Fans have theorized that this brutal juxtaposition is intentional social commentary by Oda. For marginalized groups (represented by Fish-Men and Merfolk), moments of freedom and happiness are precious and precarious. The same society that allows Sabaody Park to exist for their dreams also permits the slave trade to flourish. The ferris wheel rising above the world symbolizes aspirations for equality, while the kidnapping shows the harsh reality - in a world where the powerful can enslave others with impunity, freedom is always temporary for the vulnerable.",

    "summary": "A hypothetical scenario examining what would have happened if Bonney had been unable to stop Zoro from attacking Saint Charlos.",
    "fullText": "Episode 393 creates one of the arc's most tense moments when Zoro prepares to counterattack Saint Charlos, only to be stopped by Jewelry Bonney's quick thinking. Fans have extensively theorized about the alternate timeline where Bonney fails to intervene. If Zoro had successfully attacked or killed a Celestial Dragon, an Admiral (likely Kizaru) would have been immediately dispatched to Sabaody Archipelago. The Straw Hat Pirates, still relatively weak compared to Admiral-level opponents pre-timeskip, would have faced their greatest threat yet. Multiple outcomes are theorized: 1) The crew would have been forced to scatter or flee immediately, potentially preventing them from saving Camie; 2) Multiple pirate crews including the Supernovas might have banded together to fight the Admiral, creating a massive battle; 3) Rayleigh might have intervened earlier to protect the pirates; 4) The entire arc would have ended differently, possibly with crew member deaths or captures. This near-miss demonstrates how one moment of ignorance or recklessness could have destroyed everything, making Bonney's intervention one of the most important off-screen hero moments in the series.",
