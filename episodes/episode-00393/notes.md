# Research Notes for Episode 393

## Episode Overview
Episode 393: "The Target is Camie!! The Looming Clutches Of A Professional Kidnapper" is a pivotal episode in the Sabaody Archipelago arc that introduces key antagonists and establishes critical world-building information about Celestial Dragons.

## Research Process

### Sources Used
- Primary: One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - highly detailed and reliable
- Secondary: Behind The Voice Actors for voice cast information
- Tertiary: Fan blogs, analysis articles, and reaction videos
- Multiple wiki pages cross-referenced for accuracy

### Key Findings

#### Character Debuts
- **Saint Charlos**: Major antagonist, Celestial Dragon who demonstrates extreme cruelty
- **Peterman**: Leader of Hound Pets, kidnaps Camie
- **Marie & Judy**: Innocent victims of Charlos' cruelty

#### Major Events
1. Camie fulfills her ferris wheel dream (culturally significant for merfolk)
2. Saint Charlos shoots Judy and takes Marie
3. Zoro nearly attacks Charlos (would trigger Admiral dispatch)
4. Jewelry Bonney saves Zoro with tomato juice trick
5. Camie is kidnapped by the Hound Pets

#### World-Building
- **Admiral Dispatch Protocol**: Critical information revealed - attacking a Celestial Dragon triggers automatic Admiral deployment
- **Slave Trade**: Episode explicitly shows the slave trade operating on Sabaody
- **Merfolk Discrimination**: Ferris wheel scene highlights systemic discrimination

## Notable Observations

### Thematic Structure
The episode uses joy-before-tragedy structure effectively:
- Camie's happiness at the ferris wheel makes her kidnapping more tragic
- The park represents freedom, immediately contrasted with slavery
- Establishes moral stakes before the auction house climax

### Jewelry Bonney's Intelligence
Her quick intervention reveals:
- Deep knowledge of World Government protocols
- Strategic thinking under pressure
- Willingness to help other pirates despite being a rival captain
- Later revelations about her Celestial Dragon heritage add depth to this scene

### Animation Quality
Episode rated as "STANDARD" quality - consistent with Toei's output during this period. No sakuga moments or special animation noted.

### Ending Theme Status
Episode 393 aired during the period when One Piece omitted ending themes (episodes 279-1070, spanning over 17 years). This was a production decision to allow more runtime for story content.

## Challenges Encountered

### Voice Actor Information
- Some English voice actors for minor characters (Marie, Judy) were difficult to verify
- Bilibili had more reaction videos than YouTube for this episode
- Limited availability of full episode scripts online

### Timestamp Estimation
- Exact timestamps not available from all sources
- Had to estimate based on typical episode pacing (OP ~3min, story ~18min, preview ~1min)
- Timestamps should be considered approximate within 30-60 seconds

### Manga Comparison
- Episode covers Chapter 499 "Sabaody Park"
- Anime expanded the amusement park sequence significantly
- Some character interactions were extended for pacing
