    "theory": "Fans theorize that Crocodile either didn't have Haki during the Alabasta arc or had become complacent after years of ruling Alabasta, losing his edge as a fighter. This would explain why he was defeated by a pre-Haki Luffy using only water as a counter to his Logia powers.",

The shooting of Koza in Episode 120 reveals that Baroque Works agents were embedded even in high-ranking positions within the royal army, suggesting Crocodile's network was far more extensive than initially shown. Some fans speculate that there may have been even more infiltrators who were never revealed.",
