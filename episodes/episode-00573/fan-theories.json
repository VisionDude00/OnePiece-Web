    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Luffy won't cause Fish-Man Island's destruction by design, but perhaps due to a third party or by accident. The theory suggests that destroying Fish-Man Island will come when Luffy fulfills Joy Boy's promise to relocate the fish-men above ground, ending discrimination between humans and fish-men. The Red Line might be destroyed using Pluton, causing debris to fall on Fish-Man Island (which is directly beneath the Red Line), forcing an evacuation using Noah and Poseidon's power to relocate fish-men to the surface.",

The theory suggests that either the Marines will target Fish-Man Island as one of Luffy's territories, or Blackbeard will attack the island to get back at Luffy. In this scenario, Luffy would be standing amid the flames trying to save people, which would make Sharley's vision technically accurate while absolving Luffy of deliberate destruction.",
