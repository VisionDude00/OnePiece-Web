    "fullText": "Episode 642 reveals that Doflamingo went to extraordinary lengths - manipulating world news, coordinating with the World Government, and setting an elaborate trap - all with the single purpose of killing Law.

Theories ranged from Law having stolen something precious from Doflamingo, to Law knowing dangerous secrets about Doflamingo's past, to a deeper connection through the 'D' clan. The personal nature of Doflamingo's hatred indicated this was not just about business or the Ope Ope no Mi.",
