    "summary": "Fan theories suggest the St. Briss crew committed crimes in Skypiea and were sentenced to Cloud Drifting, a punishment where criminals are placed on a drifting cloud island to die. The ship eventually fell back to the Blue Sea after 200+ years.",
    "fullText": "Based on Robin's analysis in the episode and later revelations in the Skypiea Arc, fans theorize that the St. Briss successfully reached Skypiea over 200 years ago but the crew committed some major crime upon arrival. As punishment, they were sentenced to Cloud Drifting - a death sentence where criminals are placed on a small deserted island cloud that drifts indefinitely in the sky. The entire ship and its crew were left to die on these drifting clouds. After more than two centuries, the cloud finally dissipated or fell apart, causing the St. Briss to plummet back to the Blue Sea where the Straw Hats discovered it in Episode 144.",

    "summary": "The mysterious giant shadows seen in the Jaya Arc are theorized to be cast by people in Skypiea standing directly against the sun, with the shadows projected down to the Blue Sea below.",
    "fullText": "Fans noticed that the 'monsters' or giant shadows seen during the Jaya Arc episodes were actually clever foreshadowing for Sky Island's existence. The theory suggests these shadows are cast by people in Skypiea when they stand in direct sunlight, projecting enormous shadows down to the sea below. This was later confirmed when the Saruyama Alliance saw Luffy's shadow cast as a giant figure in the sky after he reached Skypiea. This subtle detail in Episode 144 and the surrounding Jaya Arc episodes served as visual proof that something existed in the sky above, even before the crew discovered concrete evidence.",

    "summary": "Fan analysis revealed that when the maps of Jaya island and Skypiea are combined, they form the shape of a skull, with the legendary City of Gold located in the skull's right eye.",
    "fullText": "One of the most celebrated pieces of foreshadowing in the Jaya Arc involves the geography of the islands. Fans analyzing Noland's logbook and the maps discovered in Episode 144 and beyond theorized that Jaya and Upper Yard (part of Skypiea) were originally one island that formed a skull shape. According to Noland's writings, the City of Gold was located in the 'skull's right eye.' This theory suggests that part of Jaya was launched into the sky by the Knock Up Stream 400 years ago, splitting the skull-shaped island in two. When Nami later combines the maps of modern-day Jaya and Skypiea's Upper Yard, they perfectly form a skull, with Shandora (the City of Gold) located exactly where Noland described - in the right eye socket.",

    "fullText": "When Luffy discovered the Skypiea map in the St. Briss wreckage in Episode 144, it raised questions among fans about the nature of Sky Islands. The existence of a detailed, labeled map suggested that Sky Islands are not just mythical or random floating rocks, but established locations with defined geography, possibly multiple island clouds, and developed enough to have been mapped by explorers. This theory proposed that there must be regular enough access to Sky Islands for maps to exist, and that civilizations in the sky are substantial enough to warrant cartography. The map's 200-year age also suggested Sky Islands have been accessible (though difficult to reach) for centuries, contradicting the belief among Blue Sea residents that they're purely mythological.",
