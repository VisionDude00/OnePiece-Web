### Research Challenges

- Specific episode script/transcript was not found, relied on wiki summaries and episode descriptions
- Exact timestamps are approximated based on typical episode structure
- Limited specific Reddit fan theory discussions found for this particular episode (theories are more arc-wide)
- Some external media sources lack detailed metadata (view counts, exact dates)

### Incremental Data Approach

As per instructions, all data focuses exclusively on what debuts or changes in THIS episode:
- Character entries only include Episode 144 in episodeAppearances arrays
- Key moments are limited to events in this episode only
- No attempt to build complete character profiles
- Location and crew data focuses on debut information

### Additional Notes

Episode 144 serves as an excellent setup episode that introduces multiple mysteries:
- Why is the Log Pose pointing up?
- Where did the St. Briss come from?
- What are Sky Islands?
- How can the crew reach them?

These questions drive the entire Jaya Arc (Episodes 144-152) and lead directly into the Skypiea Arc. The episode does an excellent job of combining mystery, comedy (Luffy befriending Masira), and action (the sea turtle cliffhanger) to hook viewers into the Sky Island Saga.

The introduction of Masira is particularly important as he later becomes part of the Saruyama Alliance alongside his brother Shoujou and Mont Blanc Cricket, who help the Straw Hats reach Skypiea.
