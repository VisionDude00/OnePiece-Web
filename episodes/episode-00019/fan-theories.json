    "description": "This theory proposes that Kuina's death was not actually an accident from falling down stairs, but rather she was murdered. Some versions of this theory suggest various perpetrators, from her father Koushirou to the World Government. Fans find it implausible that a skilled swordsman like Kuina, who could defeat Zoro 2001 times, would die from such a mundane accident.",

Drawing parallels to Enma (another sword created by Shimotsuki Kouzaburou), which is known to extract excessive Armament Haki from its wielder, fans theorize that Wado similarly drained Kuina's energy the day after she wielded it. The theory proposes that the sword chose her before she was ready to handle its power, ultimately leading to her death.",
