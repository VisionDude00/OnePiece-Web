    "title": "Rainbow Mist and Wano Time Travel Continuity Error",
    "theoryText": "Fans have noted a significant continuity issue between the filler Ruluka Island Arc and the canon Wano Country Arc. In the Ruluka Island Arc (Episodes 139-143), the Straw Hat Pirates, including Zoro, experience time travel when they enter the Rainbow Mist and encounter people from the past. However, in the Wano Country Arc, when the crew learns that Momonosuke and his companions traveled through time, they act surprised and unfamiliar with the concept. Zoro even makes a comment questioning the possibility of time travel, despite having personally experienced it in the Rainbow Mist. This suggests that either the filler arc is not considered part of the characters' memories in canon, or it's an oversight by the anime production team.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans have speculated about the true nature of the Rainbow Mist phenomenon. Given that it appears to be a naturally occurring time-space anomaly that preserves people and objects in temporal stasis, questions arise about whether such phenomena could exist without Devil Fruit powers. The Rainbow Mist seems to operate independently of any Devil Fruit user, suggesting that the One Piece world contains natural supernatural phenomena beyond Devil Fruits. This raises questions about other mysterious locations and whether they might have similar properties. However, since this is a filler arc, its canonical status and implications for world-building are uncertain.",

    "title": "Henzo's Friends and the Nature of Time in the Mist",
    "theoryText": "The arc establishes that fifty years passed in the normal world while Henzo's friends remained children inside the Rainbow Mist. This creates an interesting paradox: if time doesn't pass inside the mist, how did the Tarielishin ship exit the mist and return to Ruluka Island? Some fans theorize that the Rainbow Mist has 'exit windows' that open periodically, allowing objects to leave but potentially trapping people inside. Others suggest that the ship was ejected automatically while the people remained trapped, or that different areas within the mist experience time at different rates. The mechanics are intentionally kept vague in the anime, leaving room for interpretation.",
