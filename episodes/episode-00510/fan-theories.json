    "theoryText": "The 3D2Y message represents one of the most intimate experiences in One Piece, establishing a powerful bond between the Straw Hat Pirates and readers. Some fans theorize that this moment could be paralleled again in future arcs, potentially with another cryptic message or time-based separation. The theory suggests that Oda may use similar narrative devices to separate and reunite the crew during critical moments.",

      "Each crew member understood the message immediately",
      "The two-year separation led to massive power growth",
      "Similar patterns of separation and reunion occur throughout One Piece"

    "counterEvidence": [
      "The 3D2Y moment was unique to the post-Marineford situation",

Fans theorize that Robin learned valuable information about the Void Century and Poneglyphs from the Revolutionary Army, and that her connection to Dragon's organization will become crucial in later arcs.
