    "theoryText": "The unusual friendliness of Water 7's citizens toward pirates isn't a trap or 'Stepford Smiler scenario,' but rather stems from the city's confidence in its own defensive capabilities. The residents know that the Galley-La Company's shipwrights are powerful enough to defeat any pirates who cause trouble, as demonstrated when they crushed the Big Helmet Pirates despite their 36 million berry captain.",
