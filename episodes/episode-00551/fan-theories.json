Both provide dramatic power increases and physical transformations (white hair for Energy Steroids, white fur for Sulong), but Energy Steroids have severe side effects including accelerated aging, suggesting they are an incomplete or corrupted version of the Mink's natural ability.",

Unlike Arlong who had personal trauma from Fisher Tiger's death and human enslavement of Fish-Men, Hody has never personally experienced discrimination from humans. His famous answer 'Nothing' when asked what humans did to him reveals that his hatred is purely environmental conditioning from growing up in the Fish-Man District. This makes him a representation of how prejudice perpetuates across generations even without direct grievances.",

Fukaboshi's speech about peace and endurance represents the 'right' ideology (Otohime's vision), but the princes still lose because they're fighting drug-enhanced extremists. This sets up the need for Luffy and the Straw Hats - outsiders who can break the cycle because they're not bound by Fish-Man Island's historical baggage. The defeat suggests that internal conflicts rooted in generational trauma require external intervention or a completely new approach.",

The location's name references Place de la Concorde where King Louis XVI was executed during the French Revolution.

The plaza becomes a stage where Fish-Man Island's future is decided - will they repeat the cycle of violence or break it?",

    "theoryText": "The Energy Steroids introduced in the Fish-Man Island arc establish a recurring theme in One Piece about the dangers of artificial power enhancement versus natural growth. Fans theorize that Energy Steroids parallel other power systems in the series: they provide immediate strength at a terrible long-term cost (accelerated aging, physical deterioration). This contrasts with the Straw Hats' philosophy of earning power through training and struggle. The arc suggests that shortcuts to power (drugs, artificial enhancements) lead to hollow victories and self-destruction, while natural development creates lasting strength. This theme appears again with SMILE fruits and other artificial devil fruits.",
