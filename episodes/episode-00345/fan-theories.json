    "theoryText": "During the Thriller Bark arc, Lola gave Nami a vivre card and mentioned her mother is a powerful pirate in the New World. Fans theorized that this 'mother' was Charlotte Linlin (Big Mom), one of the Four Emperors. This theory was based on: 1) The emphasis on Lola's mother being a significant pirate, 2) Big Mom's epithet literally being 'Big Mom' and her role as mother to many children, 3) The vivre card connection that later played a role in the Whole Cake Island arc.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorized about how zombies in Thriller Bark gradually lose their shadow owner's personality traits over time. Inuppe initially refused to harm women due to Sanji's chivalrous nature, but according to Dr. Hogback, zombies eventually fall into total obedience and disregard even the shadow owner's heartfelt beliefs. The theory suggests that the shadow's personality is strongest immediately after implantation but degrades over time, with the zombie's body eventually taking full control.",
