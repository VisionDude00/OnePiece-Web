    "theoryText": "Enel's departure to the moon on the Ark Maxim is not the end of his story. Given his connection to the ancient moon civilization, his knowledge of Fairy Vearth, and the increasing importance of moon lore in One Piece's endgame, Enel will return to play a significant role in the Final Saga. The parallels between Enel and Imu (both destroy islands from the sky, both have god complexes, both command loyal followers) suggest Enel may become relevant again.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that 'Fairy Vearth' (Endless Earth) that Enel seeks is not actually the moon, but rather the ancient landmass that existed before the world was flooded 900 years ago during the Void Century. This would mean Enel's journey to the moon was based on a misunderstanding of ancient texts. The true 'endless earth' would be the sunken continent that once existed before the 200-meter sea level rise, portions of which now form the Red Line.",

    "theoryText": "The fact that the Ark Maxim was constructed using gold from Shandora (the City of Gold) is significant. Shandora was part of the ancient civilization that fought during the Void Century. The Poneglyph the Shandia protected contained information about Poseidon. This suggests that the gold used to build Enel's ark may have special properties or significance related to the ancient kingdom, and that Enel unknowingly used materials connected to the lost history he was trying to escape.",

This medical/scientific application of Devil Fruit powers foreshadows later revelations about Devil Fruit Awakening and creative power usage.

The specific number (200) and the fact that he preserved them from Birka before destroying it suggests these Dials may have historical or cultural significance. They could be connected to the moon people who originally came to Birka, or they might be the last remnants of Birkan technology that Enel wanted to preserve.",
