    "theoryText": "The Long Ring Long Land arc and the Davy Back Fight may be foreshadowing how Luffy and Shanks will settle their eventual confrontation. Instead of a battle to the death, they could engage in a Davy Back Fight, specifically the Combat game (one-on-one battle) just as Luffy and Foxy did. This would allow the dramatic and much-anticipated battle between the two to happen while ensuring neither has to die. It would be the perfect conclusion to their story, with Luffy finally giving back the straw hat after beating Shanks in this non-lethal competition.",

    "theoryText": "The Rocks Pirates, who built their crew using Davy Back Fights, have a flaming skull on their Jolly Roger that is extremely similar to the one that adorns Luffy's chest while wearing his Afro Luffy costume during the Davy Back Fight. Combined with the recent reveal that Rocks D. Xebec is related to Davy Jones' bloodline and used Davy Back Fights to recruit his crew, this visual parallel may be intentional foreshadowing by Eiichiro Oda, suggesting he was planning much further ahead than fans realized.",

    "theoryText": "Before it was confirmed in the manga, fans theorized that Rocks D. Xebec (with the middle initial D possibly standing for Davy) went to the pirate island Hachinosu (Beehive/Fullalead) and used Davy Back Fight competitions to recruit upstart pirates for his crew. Since Hachinosu is the birthplace of the Davy Back Fight tradition, and Rocks was a worshipper of Davy Jones, it made sense that he would use this method to build what became the most powerful pirate crew of its era. This fan theory was later confirmed in recent One Piece manga chapters.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that the Long Ring Long Land/Davy Back Fight arc, often dismissed as 'filler' or the worst arc, actually contains way deeper meaning than it appears on the surface. The arc introduces the Davy Back Fight tradition which later proves to be crucial to understanding the formation of the Rocks Pirates and potentially foreshadows future story developments. What seemed like a silly, low-stakes competition may have been Oda laying groundwork for major plot points hundreds of chapters later, demonstrating his long-term planning ability.",
