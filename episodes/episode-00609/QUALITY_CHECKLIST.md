## Research Challenges & Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **No Complete Transcript Available** - Had to reconstruct events from multiple summary sources
2. **Limited Episode-Specific Media** - Most analyses focus on full arc rather than individual episodes
3. **Timestamp Approximations** - Without access to actual episode, timestamps are estimated
4. **No Fan Theories** - No episode-specific theories found; arc-wide theories exist but span multiple episodes

### Solutions Applied:
1. Cross-referenced multiple high-reliability sources (One Piece Wiki, Wikipedia, official platforms)
2. Used community discussions and first-viewer reactions for event details
3. Estimated timestamps based on typical episode structure and event sequence
4. Documented search efforts in notes.md for transparency

### Research Quality:
- **Primary Sources Used:** 9 (official wikis and databases)
- **Secondary Sources Used:** 12 (community discussions, analyses, reviews)
- **Cross-Reference Verification:** All major events verified across 3+ sources
- **Incremental Data Focus:** ✅ Maintained throughout all JSON files
