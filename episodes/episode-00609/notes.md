### External Media Search
Found multiple podcasts reviewing Punk Hazard arc but no episode-specific YouTube analyses or reviews. Most media focuses on arc-level analysis rather than individual episodes. Community discussions found on GameFAQs and Tumblr.

### Fan Theories
No specific fan theories found for Episode 609. Most theories surrounding Punk Hazard arc focus on:
- Vegapunk's involvement

- Momonosuke's transformation
- Doflamingo's plans

These theories span multiple episodes rather than being specific to 609.

### Research Challenges
1. **No Complete Transcript:** Could not locate a full English or Japanese transcript for this specific episode. Had to rely on summaries and descriptions.

2. **Limited Episode-Specific Media:** Most external media (podcasts, reviews, analyses) focus on the Punk Hazard arc as a whole rather than individual episodes.

3. **Timestamp Approximations:** Without access to the actual episode or detailed transcript, timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and event descriptions.

4. **Voice Actor Credits:** Some English voice actors for minor characters not confirmed.
