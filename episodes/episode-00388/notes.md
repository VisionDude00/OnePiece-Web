## Research Date
December 3, 2025

## Episode Overview
Episode 388: "Tragedy! The Truth Hidden Under Duval's Mask" is one of the most memorable comedic episodes in One Piece, featuring the reveal that Duval's face is identical to Sanji's poorly-drawn wanted poster.

## Research Process

### Sources Used
- Primary: One Piece Wiki (Fandom) for episode details, character information, and production credits
- Secondary: Behind The Voice Actors for voice actor information
- Tertiary: Fan blogs, forums, and reaction videos for community perspective

### Key Findings

   - Aired: February 8, 2009 (Japan), July 14, 2015 (US DVD)
   - Adapted manga chapters 493-494
   - Part of Sabaody Archipelago Arc / Summit War Saga
   - No ending theme (ending themes stopped at episode 279)

2. **Character Debuts**
   - Duval: Technically debuted in episode 386 but face revealed in 388
   - Motobaro: Duval's giant bison companion debuts in this episode

3. **Major Events**
   - 14 significant events documented
   - Central revelation: Duval's face matches Sanji's wanted poster
   - Multiple combat sequences showcasing crew abilities

4. **Themes**
   - Consequences of actions (Sanji's wanted poster affecting innocent person)
   - Comedy in adversity
   - Crew teamwork and dynamics

### Notable Production Details

**Opening Song**: "We Are! (Tohoshinki 2008 Remix)"
- Special 10th anniversary remix
- Used for episodes 373-394
- Performed by Korean pop duo Tohoshinki (TVXQ)

**Voice Actors**:
- Duval (JP): Toshihiko Seki (known for voicing handsome characters, making this role ironic)
- Duval (EN): David Vincent

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Limited Script Access**: Could not find full episode transcripts/scripts. Relied on wiki summaries and fan discussions.

2. **Timestamp Approximation**: Exact timestamps are estimated based on episode pacing and event sequence descriptions rather than watching the episode directly.

3. **Fan Theory Scarcity**: This episode is primarily comedic without deep mysteries, so fan theories are limited and mostly focus on thematic interpretations.

4. **Ending Theme Confusion**: Initial searches for ending themes from 2009 were confusing until confirming that One Piece had no ending themes from episodes 279-1070.

### Research Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive event documentation (14 events)
- Multiple reliable sources cross-referenced
- Good coverage of character debuts and relationships
- Strong external media collection (reaction videos, articles, forums)

**Limitations**:
- Timestamps are approximations (±30 seconds likely)
- No direct episode script obtained
- Voice actor information for Motobaro not available (likely no voice actor as animal character)
- Some engagement metrics unavailable for external media

### Interesting Observations

1. **Oda's Storytelling**: This episode exemplifies Eiichiro Oda's ability to transform a minor gag (Sanji's drawn wanted poster from episode 151) into a major plot point nearly 240 episodes later.

2. **Comedic Timing**: The episode balances serious action sequences with comedy, culminating in one of the series' most memorable comedic reveals.

3. **Character Development**: Shows Brook's integration into the crew with his unique abilities (musical combat, running on water due to light skeleton).

4. **Foreshadowing**: Zoro's continued weakness from the Kuma encounter continues to be referenced, maintaining continuity from the Thriller Bark arc.

### Recommendations for Future Research

1. If possible, watch the episode directly to verify timestamps and capture any subtle details missed in summaries.

2. Search Japanese forums/sites for additional cultural context and fan reactions from original Japanese audience.

3. Look for any Oda interviews or SBS columns where he discusses the creation of the Duval character.

4. Cross-reference manga chapters 493-494 for any significant anime-only additions or changes.

The research was successful despite the lack of direct script access, with comprehensive coverage achieved through multiple reliable sources.
