    "summary": "Blackbeard ate a Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit, possibly the Dog-Dog Fruit: Model Cerberus, before consuming the Yami Yami no Mi. Like the mythical Cerberus with three heads having independent thought, this allows Teach to use more than one Devil Fruit.",
    "fullText": "The Cerberus Theory is one of the most popular explanations for Blackbeard's dual Devil Fruit abilities. Fans theorize that Blackbeard had already eaten a Mythical Zoan Fruit called the Dog-Dog Fruit: Model Cerberus before he ate the Dark-Dark Fruit. The Cerberus is a three-headed dog from mythology, and each head has independent consciousness. This would allow Teach to possess multiple Devil Fruits because each 'head' or consciousness can host a different power. This theory is supported by Blackbeard's Jolly Roger featuring three skulls, and the fact that Marco mentioned Teach's body is 'atypical' or 'abnormal.' The theory gained even more traction after Episode 486 when Blackbeard demonstrated two Devil Fruits, as fans speculated he might eventually gain a third power.",

    "summary": "The Dark-Dark Fruit's unique ability to nullify other Devil Fruit powers also allows Blackbeard to suppress the destructive clash that normally occurs when someone consumes two Devil Fruits, enabling him to safely possess multiple powers.",
    "fullText": "This theory proposes that the Yami Yami no Mi's greatest power - its unique ability to shut off another Devil Fruit user's powers with physical touch - is the key to Blackbeard's multiple Devil Fruits. Fans believe this power, or an extension of it, allowed Blackbeard to take Whitebeard's Devil Fruit abilities. The theory suggests that the power of the Yami Yami no Mi is constantly suppressing the powers of the Gura Gura no Mi to prevent them from clashing. Normally, any individual who consumes more than one Devil Fruit is bound to explode or die because of the clash of the Devil Fruit powers within the body, but the Yami Yami no Mi allows Blackbeard to suppress this clash. This would explain why Blackbeard was so desperate to acquire the Yami Yami no Mi specifically, as it was essential to his master plan of collecting multiple Devil Fruits.",

    "summary": "Blackbeard has multiple personalities or souls within his body, as hinted when Zoro and Luffy corrected Nami by saying 'they' instead of 'he' when referring to Blackbeard in the Jaya Arc. Each personality can host a different Devil Fruit.",
    "fullText": "This theory stems from a cryptic moment in the Jaya Arc (around Episode 151) where Luffy and Zoro refer to Blackbeard as 'they' instead of 'he,' suggesting he isn't just one normal person. One Piece fans are convinced the pirate has multiple personalities or souls, and that this was foreshadowed from his introduction. The theory proposes that Blackbeard's body houses multiple consciousnesses or souls, each capable of hosting a different Devil Fruit power. This would explain how he can possess multiple Devil Fruits without dying - each personality/soul 'owns' a different fruit. Some fans connect this to Blackbeard's statement that he 'never sleeps,' suggesting different personalities take turns being active. The theory also ties into the mystery of Blackbeard's unusual body that Marco mentioned, and explains the three skulls on his Jolly Roger representing three different beings sharing one body.",

    "summary": "Blackbeard never sleeps because he must constantly use his Yami Yami no Mi power to suppress the Gura Gura no Mi, preventing the two Devil Fruits from clashing and killing him. If he sleeps, the suppression stops and he would die.",
    "fullText": "This theory builds on the Yami Yami no Mi Suppression Theory but adds an important element - why Blackbeard never sleeps. The theory proposes that Blackbeard must maintain constant conscious control of his Yami Yami no Mi to suppress the Gura Gura no Mi's power. If he were to sleep and lose conscious control, the two Devil Fruits would clash and kill him instantly. This would explain the repeated mentions throughout the series that Blackbeard has never been seen sleeping. The theory suggests that if Blackbeard acquires a third Devil Fruit (as some fans speculate), he might reach his limit and 'blow up instantly' because even his Yami Yami no Mi wouldn't be able to suppress multiple fruits. This creates a natural ceiling for how many Devil Fruits Blackbeard can safely possess.",

    "summary": "The black cloth Blackbeard used to cover Whitebeard's body is the key to his Devil Fruit extraction method. Under the cloth, Blackbeard used his Yami Yami no Mi to extract the Devil Fruit from Whitebeard's body before it could respawn elsewhere.",
    "fullText": "This theory focuses on the mysterious black cloth scene in Episode 486. Fans theorize that the black cloth served a specific purpose in Blackbeard's Devil Fruit extraction process. Under the cloth, Blackbeard used his Yami Yami no Mi's unique properties - particularly its ability to 'attract' and 'absorb' things into darkness - to capture the Gura Gura no Mi as it left Whitebeard's body upon his death. Normally, when a Devil Fruit user dies, the fruit respawns at a random location in the world. However, Blackbeard's darkness power may have allowed him to intercept this process and absorb the Devil Fruit directly into his own body. The cloth was necessary to hide the method from observers and prevent others from learning and replicating his technique. This theory explains why Blackbeard specifically needed the Yami Yami no Mi for his master plan - it's not just about suppressing multiple fruits, but about extracting them from dead users.",
