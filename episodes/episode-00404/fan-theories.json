    "theory": "Whenever Bartholomew Kuma appears in the story, the plot will veer off in a wildly divergent direction from what was originally predicted. This theory, coined by a first-time watcher, suggests that Kuma is a narrative catalyst whose appearances fundamentally change the story's trajectory.",

    "theory": "When Kuma makes Zoro disappear in Episode 404, the theory emerged that he was teleporting the crew members rather than killing them. Evidence cited includes Moria's dismissive reaction to similar events at Thriller Bark, suggesting these characters survive Kuma's power. The bubble-like effect and Kuma's question about 'vacation destinations' hint at transportation rather than elimination.",

By holding off Kizaru but not defeating him, Rayleigh allowed Kuma to separate the crew to locations where they could grow stronger before attempting the New World.",
