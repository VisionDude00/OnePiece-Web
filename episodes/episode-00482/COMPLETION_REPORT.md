## Challenges Encountered

### 1. US Television Air Date
**Issue:** Could not find definitive US television broadcast date on Toonami/Adult Swim.
**Resolution:** Used US simulcast date (January 8, 2011). Documented that Toonami only reached episode 384 before removing One Piece in 2017, so episode 482 was likely streaming-only.

### 2. Exact Timestamps
**Issue:** No direct access to episode video for precise timestamps.
**Resolution:** Estimated timestamps based on typical episode structure and scene descriptions. Noted in documentation that timestamps are approximate (±30 seconds accuracy).

### 3. Complete Episode Script
**Issue:** Could not locate a full line-by-line script.
**Resolution:** Pieced together plot information from multiple wiki sources, summaries, and analyses. Cross-referenced multiple sources for accuracy.

### 4. Limited YouTube Metrics
**Issue:** Many reaction videos don't display view counts or engagement metrics.
**Resolution:** Documented videos without metrics, noted when available.

## Key Findings

### Critical Narrative Moment
This episode features one of the most significant character deaths in One Piece and anime history. Ace's sacrifice fundamentally changes the trajectory of the series, marking the transition from the first half to the post-timeskip era.

### Devil Fruit Hierarchy Revelation
The episode establishes an important world-building principle: not all Logia-type Devil Fruits are equal. The scientific reality that magma burns hotter than fire becomes a crucial plot element.

### Emotional Impact
- **Voice Acting:** Mayumi Tanaka (Luffy) later revealed she initially didn't want to come to the studio for episode 483 due to emotional difficulty
- **Fan Reception:** 9.7/10 IMDb rating, countless reaction videos and analyses
- **Cultural Significance:** Became a defining moment in shounen anime

### Psychological Warfare
Akainu's deliberate provocation of Ace demonstrates sophisticated tactical thinking, exploiting known psychological weaknesses to achieve strategic objectives.

5. **Japanese Fan Reactions** - Current research limited to English sources
6. **Detailed Manga Comparison** - Panel-by-panel comparison with Chapter 573
