### Step 7: Sources Documented
- 14 sources total
- Mix of official sources (Crunchyroll), high-reliability wikis (One Piece Wiki, Wikipedia), and fan content
- All sources accessed on 2026-01-04

## Key Observations

### Episode Highlights
1. **Caesar's Backstory:** First detailed explanation of the Punk Hazard disaster
2. **Smiley Reveal:** Important world-building about Devil Fruits being fed to non-living substances
3. **Robin's Wing:** First anime appearance of this post-timeskip technique
4. **Alliance Dynamics:** Perfect encapsulation of Luffy vs Law's contrasting approaches

### Production Notes
- **Animation Director:** Masahiro Shimanuki

- **Screenplay:** Yoshiyuki Suga
- **Opening:** "Hands Up!" by Kōta Shinzato (episodes 591-628)
- **Ending:** "A Thousand Dreamers" by Tackey & Tsubasa (episodes 590-628)

- Ryūsei Nakao (Caesar's Japanese VA) also voiced Frieza in Dragon Ball Z, bringing similar manic villain energy

### Manga Differences
- Extended flashback sequences not in manga
- Additional comedy scenes with body-swap situation
- Expanded dialogue and character reactions

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Limited Episode-Specific External Media:**
   - Most reviews/reactions cover episode ranges (3-5 episodes at once)
   - Punk Hazard arc episodes 590-600 often grouped together
   - Solution: Included multi-episode content that covers episode 595

2. **Timestamp Estimation:**
   - No access to actual video for exact timestamps
   - Used typical episode structure to estimate:
     - Opening: 0:00-2:30
     - First act: 2:30-8:00
     - Second act: 8:00-15:00
     - Third act: 15:00-22:00
   - Timestamps are approximate but reasonable

3. **Fan Theory Specificity:**
   - Limited theories specifically about episode 595 alone
   - Most theories relate to broader Punk Hazard arc or future arcs
   - Created theories based on reveals in this episode that sparked discussion
