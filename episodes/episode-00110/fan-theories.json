    "summary": "Fans theorize that Crocodile's weakness to water goes beyond the standard Devil Fruit user weakness, as sand specifically solidifies when wet, making him uniquely vulnerable.",
    "fullText": "The Suna Suna no Mi has a specific elemental weakness to water beyond what normal Devil Fruit users experience. While all Devil Fruit users become weak in seawater, Crocodile's sand body has an additional vulnerability - any moisture (including regular water, not just seawater) causes his sand to solidify and become tangible. This unique property is what allows Luffy to eventually hit him by using water and blood, giving him a fighting chance against an otherwise invincible Logia user. This discovery in Episode 110 when water splashes on Crocodile becomes the foundation for Luffy's strategy in their later battles.",

    "summary": "A controversial theory debates whether Luffy's eventual victory over Crocodile was realistic given their massive power difference, or if Oda allowed plot armor to override logical power scaling.",
    "fullText": "Many fans argue that Crocodile was significantly stronger than Luffy during the Arabasta Arc, and realistically, Luffy should not have been able to defeat a Warlord of the Sea at that point in his journey. The theory points to Crocodile's two decisive victories (including the devastating Round 1 in Episode 110) as evidence of the gap in their abilities. Some believe Luffy only won because of the specific water/blood weakness exploitation, luck, and determination rather than being truly stronger. Others counter that this demonstrates One Piece's core theme - that willpower, creativity, and finding weaknesses can overcome raw power. This debate continues among fans about whether Oda balanced the fight appropriately or if Luffy's victory was premature character growth.",

    "summary": "Fans discuss why Luffy can drink water and use it as a weapon without experiencing Devil Fruit weakness, concluding that 'moving water' within the body doesn't cause the same weakness as submersion.",
    "fullText": "A common question arising from Episode 110 and the later battles is why Luffy doesn't weaken when using water against Crocodile, despite being a Devil Fruit user himself. The community theory explains that Devil Fruit users are only weakened by standing water or submersion - water that is contained within their body (like drinking water or 'Water Luffy' in Round 2) is constantly moving and doesn't trigger the weakness. Additionally, the water is submerged within him rather than surrounding him, which according to the established rules should be fine. This explanation has become widely accepted as the reason Luffy's water-based strategies work without backfiring on him.",
