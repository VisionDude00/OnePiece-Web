    "theory": "Jinbe's emotional intervention and his ability to reach Luffy when no one else could foreshadows his eventual joining of the Straw Hat Pirates. His wisdom, emotional intelligence, and understanding of Luffy's pain demonstrate why he would become an invaluable crew member. The fact that he helped Luffy remember what he still has - his crew - symbolically makes Jinbe part of that crew himself.",

After losing Ace, Luffy will grow stronger not just physically but emotionally, learning to treasure and protect what he still has rather than dwelling on losses. This philosophy will drive his decision to train for two years and become strong enough to protect his crew from any threat.",
