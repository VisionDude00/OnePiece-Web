Episode 629 "Startling! The Big News Shakes Up the New World!" is the first episode of the Dressrosa Arc and represents a major turning point in the series. It aired on January 19, 2014, in Japan and premiered the 15th anniversary opening theme "Wake up!" by AAA.

## Key Research Findings

3. **Crocodile Confirmation**: The anime clarifies that the shadowy figure in the manga is Crocodile, showing his fur coat and golden hook explicitly.

### Anime-Original Content
The episode includes several anime-original additions:
- Buggy's fourth-wall-breaking speech declaring he'll become an Emperor (which later came true)
- Clearer confirmation of Crocodile's identity
- Additional scene with Machvise yelling at Baby 5

### Production Notes

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
I was unable to find a full episode script/transcript for Episode 629. Sources like Forever Dreaming and Anime Transcripts Wiki were identified but the specific episode transcript was not accessible. This limited my ability to provide exact quotes for all scenes.

### Timestamp Accuracy
Without access to the actual episode video, timestamps were estimated based on typical episode pacing and plot progression. These should be verified against the actual episode for accuracy.

### Voice Actor Verification
While I verified main cast voice actors through Behind The Voice Actors and the One Piece Wiki, some minor character voice actors (like Machvise, Lao G, Giolla) may need additional verification.

## Significant Observations

### Foreshadowing
Buggy's anime-original declaration about becoming an Emperor is one of the most interesting cases of accidental/intentional foreshadowing in the series. Eight years later, this comedic moment became reality.

### Arc Setup
This episode is masterfully constructed as an arc opening, providing:
- World reactions to establish scope
- Multiple plot threads (tournament, factory destruction, hostage exchange)
- Character introductions without overwhelming viewers
- Emotional hook through Ace's fruit

### Animation Quality
Rated as "STANDARD" - this is early Dressrosa Arc, which is known for having average animation quality compared to later arcs like Wano. The focus is on dialogue and setup rather than action.

### Episode Pacing
The episode serves primarily as a setup/reaction episode with minimal action. It's designed to:
1. Show worldwide reactions to major news
2. Establish the Donquixote Pirates' hierarchy
3. Set up multiple plotlines for the arc
4. Create emotional stakes with the Mera Mera no Mi

## Fan Reception

- Effective setup for the arc

- Building anticipation for Dressrosa

Critics noted:
