    "fullText": "After Episode 629 revealed that Doflamingo possesses the Mera Mera no Mi, fans began theorizing about how he acquired it. The main theories include: (1) The World Government had Devil Fruits on standby to collect after the Marineford War and may have given the Mera Mera no Mi to Doflamingo considering his importance in the New World and his secret knowledge about the Celestial Dragons. (2) The fruit reincarnated on another island and was acquired through Doflamingo's extensive underworld connections and intelligence network. (3) Doflamingo's crew was actively searching for powerful Devil Fruits and happened upon it. The episode doesn't explain the mechanism, leading to significant fan speculation about Devil Fruit reincarnation mechanics.",

    "summary": "Fans debated why Doflamingo would use such a powerful Devil Fruit as bait rather than having one of his executives eat it to strengthen his crew.",
    "fullText": "When Episode 629 revealed that Doflamingo possessed the Mera Mera no Mi but planned to use it as tournament bait rather than giving it to one of his executives, fans theorized about his reasoning. Popular theories include: (1) Doflamingo's organization was already so powerful that the Mera Mera no Mi was more valuable as a psychological weapon against Luffy than as an addition to his crew's strength. (2) Doflamingo intended to use it to erode Luffy's alliance with Law, knowing Luffy would charge in emotionally to prevent Ace's Devil Fruit from falling into the wrong hands, potentially disrupting their careful plans. (3) Doflamingo was saving it for someone specific (possibly revealed later in the arc). (4) The fruit was meant to attract powerful fighters to his tournament, serving multiple purposes including entertainment, recruitment, and distraction.",

    "fullText": "In an anime-original scene in Episode 629, Buggy breaks the fourth wall and declares that after becoming a Warlord, he'll become one of the Four Emperors and then the Pirate King before being silenced. At the time, this was seen as pure comedy emphasizing Buggy's delusional nature. However, when Buggy actually became recognized as an Emperor eight years later (Episode 1056), fans began theorizing whether this was: (1) An incredible coincidence that the anime staff accidentally predicted Oda's plans. (2) Intentional foreshadowing, with the anime team being told by Oda about Buggy's future trajectory. (3) Oda being inspired by the anime's comedic scene and deciding to make it canon later. The prophetic nature of this throwaway gag line has become legendary in the community as evidence of One Piece's long-term planning.",

    "fullText": "Episode 629's anime-original clarification that the shadowy figure reading the news was Crocodile (confirmed by his fur coat and hook) sparked theories about his presence in the New World and his intentions. Theories include: (1) Crocodile is building a new criminal organization in the New World, possibly to rival the Emperors. (2) He's searching for information about the Ancient Weapons, continuing his Alabasta-era obsession. (3) He's monitoring Luffy's progress out of a strange respect developed during Marineford. (4) He's planning to join or ally with one of the major powers in the New World. (5) He's investigating the truth about his past or seeking revenge against someone. The brief cameo left many questions unanswered, leading to extensive speculation about Crocodile's post-timeskip activities and whether he'll return as an ally, enemy, or neutral party.",

    "fullText": "Episode 629 showed Doflamingo confidently resigning from the Seven Warlords, a position of great power and protection. Fans immediately theorized he must have significant leverage or connections to do this so boldly. Theories included: (1) Doflamingo has secret knowledge about the Celestial Dragons or World Government that protects him from retaliation. (2) His position as a broker in the underworld makes him too valuable to eliminate. (3) He has connections to powerful figures that give him immunity. (4) His SMILE Factory production is crucial to Kaido, and the World Government fears what would happen if they moved against him. This resignation being a 'fake' move also sparked theories about cooperation between Doflamingo and the government. These theories proved prescient when later episodes revealed Doflamingo's Celestial Dragon heritage and his blackmail of the World Government.",
