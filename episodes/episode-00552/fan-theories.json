    "theoryText": "By not revealing that Hody Jones assassinated Queen Otohime, Shirahoshi's silence - while honoring her mother's wish to avoid revenge - inadvertently allowed Hody to amass power and followers in preparation for his eventual coup. If she had exposed him earlier, it could have brought Hody to justice and prevented the war on Fish-Man Island.",

Unlike Arlong who experienced genuine persecution, Hody simply hates humans because he was raised to hate them. This makes him a representation of how prejudice and hatred can be passed down through generations without any personal justification, creating a cycle of violence based purely on inherited ideology.",
