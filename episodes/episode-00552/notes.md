## Key Observations

### Hody Jones's Confession
- This episode contains one of the most important revelations of the Fish-Man Island arc
- Hody's confession that he assassinated Queen Otohime is shocking but not entirely unexpected to viewers who noticed the foreshadowing

### Shirahoshi's Strength
- Shirahoshi's revelation that she already knew Hody killed her mother is incredibly powerful
- She kept this secret for 10 years to honor her mother's dying wish not to seek revenge
- This demonstrates remarkable maturity and strength of character for someone so young
- Creates a moral dilemma: was her silence the right choice, or did it enable Hody's rise to power?
