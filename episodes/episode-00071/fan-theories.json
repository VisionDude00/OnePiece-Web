    "summary": "The century-long duel between Dorry and Brogy introduced in Episode 71 foreshadowed their eventual deaths, with their statement that giant duels only end in death being a 24-year setup for future events.",
    "fullText": "When Dorry and Brogy were first introduced in the Little Garden arc (Episode 71, Chapter 116 in 1999), they explained their century-long battle and mentioned that duels between giants traditionally continue until death. Chapter 1126 reinforced this by having them state that death is the final result of any duel, especially for giants. With recent manga events showing Imu transforming Dorry and Brogy during the Elbaph arc, many fans believe this 24-year-old setup may finally be paying off, potentially leading to the tragic deaths of these beloved characters.",

    "summary": "The 'Hakoku Sovereignty' attack used by Dorry and Brogy may contain a fourth type of Haki that will be revealed during the Elbaph arc, connecting back to their introduction in Episode 71.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Dorry and Brogy's combined attack 'Hakoku Sovereignty' (Hakoku meaning 'Supreme Reign'), which creates compressed air beams capable of obliterating anything in their path, may contain an unknown fourth type of Haki. While the attack was first shown in the Little Garden arc, its true nature may not be fully revealed until the Elbaph arc. The name itself contains 'Haku' which could relate to Haki, and the devastating power seems to go beyond normal physical strength. Some theorists connect this to Usopp's potential development during Elbaph, as he has deep connections to both giants from his time on Little Garden.",

When Usopp meets Brogy and witnesses the giants' warrior culture and honor code, he is inspired and begins to see what it means to be a true brave warrior.
