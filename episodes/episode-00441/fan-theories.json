    "theoryText": "Some fans theorized that Ivankov and Inazuma's imprisonment in Impel Down may not have been accidental. Instead, they may have allowed themselves to be captured to create a secret base (Level 5.5) that could be used for a future prison break or to free important prisoners. The creation of New Kama Land and the subsequent mass breakout lends credence to this theory.",
