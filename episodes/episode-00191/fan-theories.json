    "theoryText": "The Ark Maxim was inspired by the Ancient Weapon Uranus. A mural shown in Chapter 1138 depicts a ship that closely resembles Ark Maxim, suggesting Enel may have drawn inspiration from Uranus to create his ship. Both are capable of massive destruction and are the only flying ships in the series. While Uranus is powered by the Mother Flame, Ark Maxim uses Enel's Goro Goro no Mi electrical powers. This theory suggests Enel has access to ancient knowledge about the Ancient Weapons.",

    "theoryText": "The technology behind Ark Maxim comes from the ancient moon civilization. All three main races that originated from the Moon contributed to its construction: Birka provided electricity knowledge, Shandorians provided gold, and Skypieans provided shipbuilding expertise. This theory suggests Enel's journey to the moon was not random - he somehow knew exactly what was needed to build such a ship and where to find it, indicating he may have had access to ancient knowledge about the moon civilization.",

    "theoryText": "An older theory proposes that Pluton, one of the Ancient Weapons, is a flying airship powered by electricity and uses gold as a conductor. According to this theory, Ark Maxim is essentially a miniature version of Pluton. This would explain why Enel was able to create such a devastating weapon - he was unknowingly recreating an Ancient Weapon using similar principles. The theory connects the themes of ancient technology and lost civilizations that run throughout the Skypiea arc.",

The flashback showing Nola's emotional connection to Kalgara and Seto, combined with the snake's incredible longevity, suggests Nola may have a larger role to play in fulfilling the ancient promise. This theory proposes that when Cricket hears the bell, Nola will finally find peace after 400 years of waiting.",

    "theoryText": "Wyper's willingness to use the Reject Dial multiple times despite the severe damage to his body is a physical manifestation of the 'Inherited Will' theme central to One Piece. Just as Kalgara gave everything to protect his people and ring the bell for Noland, Wyper literally destroys his own body to honor that legacy. This theory suggests that the Reject Dial serves as a symbolic representation of how inherited will can push someone beyond their physical limits, even at great personal cost.",
