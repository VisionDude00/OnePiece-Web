# Research Notes for Episode 490

## Episode Overview
Episode 490 "Mighty Leaders Face Each Other Down! Heralding the 'New Era'!" is the first episode of the Post-War Arc and serves as a crucial transitional episode following the devastating Summit War of Marineford.

## Key Research Findings

### Production Notes
- **Delayed Broadcast**: Originally scheduled for March 13, 2011, but delayed by one week to March 20, 2011 due to extensive news coverage of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami (March 11, 2011)
- **Historical Context**: This episode aired during a tragic period in Japanese history, which adds poignant context to its themes of destruction and rebuilding

### Character Debuts
This episode features the first appearances of four major Blackbeard Pirates members:
1. **Catarina Devon** - "Crescent Moon Hunter", Sixth Ship Captain
2. **Vasco Shot** - "Heavy Drinker", Eighth Ship Captain
3. **San Juan Wolf** - Colossal giant, Seventh Ship Captain
4. **Avalo Pizarro** - "Corrupt King", Fourth Ship Captain

All four were recruited from Impel Down Level 6 through Blackbeard's brutal death match selection process.

### Major Plot Points
1. **Impel Down Aftermath**: Full revelation of the Level 6 prisoner escape and Magellan's critical condition
2. **Government Cover-Up**: World Government orders the breakout to be kept secret from the public
3. **Moria's Elimination Attempt**: Doflamingo attacks Moria under orders from "even higher up" than Sengoku
4. **Supernova Reactions**: Kid, Hawkins, and Apoo react to the new era from their ships
5. **Law's Submarine**: Hancock and Ivankov arrive to check on Luffy's condition

### Thematic Analysis
The episode title's Japanese phrase "群雄割拠" (Gun'yūkakkyosu) is particularly meaningful - it's an idiom meaning "rival warlords vying for supremacy" or "great men struggling for power," perfectly encapsulating the chaotic new era beginning after Whitebeard's death.

### Research Challenges
1. **Limited YouTube Content**: Could not find specific YouTube reaction or analysis videos for this episode in the search results
2. **Episode-Specific Theories**: Most fan theories are general to the Post-War Arc rather than specific to Episode 490
3. **Timestamp Accuracy**: Exact timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and event flow, as full episode scripts were not available

### Notable Quotes
The episode contains several memorable quotes that define the new era:
- Kid's declaration: "It's not over. This is the beginning of the New Age, one which no one has ever laid eyes on."
- Doflamingo's cryptic response: "Try even higher up." (regarding who ordered Moria's elimination)
- Hawkins' observation: "It's odd... the odds of Straw Hat Luffy being alive never reaches zero."

### Manga Comparison
Episode 490 primarily adapts Chapter 581 of the manga, with some expanded scenes for the anime:
- Extended Supernova reaction scenes
- More detailed visualization of Level 6 prisoners and their escapes
- Additional dialogue and character moments

### Questions and Observations
1. **Higher Authority**: Doflamingo's mention of an authority "even higher up" than Sengoku was one of the first explicit hints at the Gorosei/Celestial Dragons' direct involvement in Warlord decisions
2. **Hawkins' Fortune**: The significance of Hawkins' observation about Luffy's survival odds became more apparent as the series progressed and revealed more about the Will of D
3. **Law's Motivations**: Apoo's question about Law's motives for saving Luffy remained a mystery until the Punk Hazard arc

### Additional Context
- This episode marks a major tonal shift in One Piece, moving from the intense action of Marineford to the introspective aftermath
- The scattered reactions from around the world show the global impact of the Summit War
- The introduction of multiple Level 6 criminals sets up future antagonists and conflicts
