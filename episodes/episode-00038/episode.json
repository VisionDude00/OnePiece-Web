Luffy uses a new spinning technique to defeat most of the fish-men, but becomes trapped when his feet get stuck in concrete. Arlong exploits this weakness by throwing Luffy into a pool to drown. Meanwhile, Sanji, Zoro, and Usopp each face off against Arlong's three officers: Kuroobi, Hatchan, and Chew.",
