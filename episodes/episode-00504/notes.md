# Research Notes for Episode 504

## Episode Information
- **Title:** "To Fulfill the Promise - Separate Departures!"
- **Japanese Title:** "Yakusoku o Hatasu Tame: Sorezore no Tabidachi!"
- **Air Date (Japan):** June 26, 2011
- **Air Date (US):** June 25, 2011 (Funimation Simulcast)
- **Arc:** Post-War Arc
- **Saga:** Summit War Saga
- **Manga Chapters:** Chapter 1 (p. 48-53) and Chapter 589 (p. 7-19)

## Research Process

### What Went Well
1. **Comprehensive Wiki Information:** The One Piece Wiki provided excellent detail about the episode's plot, production credits, and trivia.
2. **Voice Actor Information:** Behind The Voice Actors database had complete cast information for both Japanese and English versions.
3. **Multiple Sources:** Found multiple blog posts and reviews discussing the episode's emotional impact.
4. **Foreshadowing Discovery:** Successfully identified the critical Sabo rescue foreshadowing scene.

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. No Full Episode Script Available
- **Issue:** Could not locate a complete transcript or script for Episode 504.
- **Workaround:** Used detailed plot summaries from multiple sources (One Piece Wiki, blog reviews, episode guides) to reconstruct the episode's key moments.
- **Impact:** Timestamps are approximate rather than exact. Used logical placement based on episode structure.

#### 2. Limited External Media
- **Issue:** Found limited YouTube analysis videos or podcast episodes specifically about Episode 504.
- **Finding:** Most external media covered the entire Post-War Arc (episodes 493-516) rather than individual episodes.
- **Result:** Included arc-wide reviews that discuss Episode 504 as part of the larger narrative.

#### 3. No Ending Theme
- **Issue:** Initially searched for ending theme information.
- **Resolution:** Discovered that One Piece had no ending themes from episodes 279-1070. The opening theme "Fight Together" was extended to compensate.

#### 4. Timestamp Precision
- **Issue:** Without access to the actual episode or a timestamped script, timestamps are estimates.
- **Approach:** Used logical placement based on typical One Piece episode structure (opening ~2 min, flashback sequences, present-day scenes at end).
- **Note:** All timestamps should be considered approximate (±30 seconds to 1 minute).

## Key Findings

### 1. Major Foreshadowing
Episode 504 contains critical foreshadowing of Sabo's survival through the scene where Dragon returns to the Revolutionary Army ship carrying someone who needs medical attention. This wasn't explicitly confirmed until Episode 663 and Episode 737.

### 2. First Proper Animation
This is the first time Luffy's defeat of the Lord of the Coast is properly animated. In Episodes 1 and 4, this moment was only briefly shown or referenced.

### 3. Emotional Parallel Structure
The episode cleverly alternates between hopeful flashback sequences (Ace and Luffy's departures) and devastating present-day scenes (Luffy's grief over Ace's death), creating powerful dramatic irony.

### 4. Tragic Irony
Ace's promise to Luffy that he "won't die because he has a weak little brother to take care of" becomes tragically ironic, as Ace ultimately dies protecting Luffy at Marineford.

### 5. Baltigo First Mention
This episode marks the first mention of Baltigo as the Revolutionary Army's headquarters.

### 2. Ace's Promise as Foreshadowing (CONFIRMED)
The community recognized Ace's promise as tragic foreshadowing of his death protecting Luffy, with many noting the irony after Episode 483.

## Data Quality Assessment

### High Confidence
- Episode title, air dates, arc/saga placement
- Production credits
- Character appearances
- Major plot points
- Voice actor information
- Opening/ending song information

### Medium Confidence
- Exact timestamps (approximate within 1 minute)
- Specific dialogue quotes (paraphrased from summaries)
- Animation quality assessment

### Low Confidence

- Minor background character appearances
- Precise duration of scenes

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. **Watch Episode Directly:** For more precise timestamps and exact dialogue, watching the episode would be beneficial.
2. **Cross-Reference:** Compare with manga chapters 1 and 589 for exact dialogue from source material.
3. **Additional External Media:** Continue searching for episode-specific reactions and analyses that may emerge over time.

## Questions for Review

1. Should the "Lord of the Coast" be added as a character entry? (Currently referenced but no character profile created)
2. Should Makino and the Windmill Village Mayor be added to characters.json given their brief appearances?
3. Are the timestamp estimates acceptable, or should they be verified against the actual episode?
4. Should Revolutionary Army members be listed as minor characters?
