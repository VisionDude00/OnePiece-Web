    "theoryText": "The mysterious person Dragon is shown carrying to the Revolutionary Army ship in Episode 504 is Sabo, who survived the Celestial Dragon attack. The urgency with which the Revolutionary Army members call for a doctor, combined with Ivankov's questioning of Dragon, suggests this person is someone important. Given the timing and location (East Blue, after Sabo's ship was destroyed), fans theorized this was Sabo before his survival was officially confirmed.",

    "theoryText": "Ace's promise to Luffy that he 'won't die because he has a weak little brother to take care of' is tragically ironic foreshadowing of his death at Marineford. This promise, made during their childhood training, highlights Ace's protective nature toward Luffy and makes his ultimate sacrifice even more emotionally devastating. The promise becomes tragically fulfilled in reverse - Ace dies precisely because he's protecting his little brother.",
