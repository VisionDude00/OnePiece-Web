    "theory": "Some fans have theorized that the Rainbow Mist's time-displacement mechanics in the Ruluka Island Arc might have been an early concept test for time-travel elements in One Piece, potentially foreshadowing the introduction of the Toki Toki no Mi (Time-Time Fruit) much later in the series.",

    "theory": "The Ruluka Island Arc presents one of the few stable time loops in One Piece. Fans have debated whether the Pumpkin Pirates always knew they would become the Marines pursuing the Straw Hats, or if this was determined only after they entered the Rainbow Mist. The fact that Rapanui and his crew deliberately avoided telling Henzo the truth suggests they understood they needed to maintain the timeline.",

Some fans appreciate that even in filler content, the anime team effectively sets up the next major canon storyline, making the transition from filler to canon feel more seamless.",
