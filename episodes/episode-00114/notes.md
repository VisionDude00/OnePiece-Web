**Air Date (Japan):** June 9, 2002

## Research Process

### Sources Found
- Successfully located comprehensive wiki information on Fandom
- Found detailed manga chapter information (Chapters 184-185)
- Located first-time viewer blog review (Never Watched One Piece)
- Found podcast coverage (One Journey Podcast)
- Located character analysis articles from CBR
- IMDb page with user rating (7.8/10)

### Research Challenges

1. **Episode Script Access**
   - Could not locate a full, detailed episode script/transcript
   - Relied on manga chapters, wiki summaries, and episode analyses instead
   - This is acceptable per the research instructions when scripts are unavailable

2. **Timestamp Precision**
   - Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and event sequence
   - Without access to the actual video, precise timestamps (within 5-10 seconds) are approximations
   - Timestamps follow logical episode flow: opening (0:00-2:00), early events (2:00-8:00), mid-episode (8:00-16:00), climax (16:00-22:00)

3. **External Media Limitations**
   - Many YouTube reactions for this older episode are behind Patreon paywalls
   - Reddit discussions for episodes from 2002 are difficult to locate in 2025
   - Site-specific search queries encountered technical issues
   - Still managed to document 7 external media sources

4. **Voice Actor Information**
   - Some voice actor credits are based on general series knowledge rather than episode-specific credits
   - Japanese voice actors are well-documented and reliable
   - English dub voice actors based on Funimation dub information

## Notable Quotes Captured

1. "Even if Luffy is dead, I have to protect his dream! I swear on my crewmate's dream!" - Usopp
2. "Your captain Straw Hat Luffy has already been defeated by Sir Crocodile!" - Miss Merry Christmas
3. "I've figured it out! All the tunnels are connected!" - Chopper
4. "Take this! My 5-ton hammer!" - Usopp

## Final Notes

This episode represents a crucial character development moment for Usopp that resonates throughout the entire series. The "fighting for friends' dreams" theme established here becomes a cornerstone of the Straw Hat Pirates' philosophy. Despite being an "in-between" episode of a three-episode battle, it contains significant emotional and thematic weight that justifies its place in One Piece history.

The research was comprehensive despite the challenges of finding detailed information about a 23-year-old anime episode. The incremental approach worked well - documenting only what Episode 114 specifically contributes to the larger One Piece narrative.
