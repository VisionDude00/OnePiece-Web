    "theoryText": "Kuzan's statement about not trusting the World Government and his mysterious activities mentioned by Doflamingo suggest he may be working as a double agent. The theory proposes that Kuzan is actually a member of SWORD (the secret Marine special forces) and is infiltrating the Blackbeard Pirates to gather intelligence or work towards a currently unknown goal. His conversation with Smoker in this episode hints at his continued commitment to justice, just through unconventional means.",

    "theoryText": "Following Kuzan's statement about making a difference outside the Marines and Doflamingo's mention of rumors, some fans theorize that Kuzan is simply trying to reach Laugh Tale by aligning himself with Blackbeard. This theory suggests that Kuzan believes Blackbeard has the highest chance of reaching Laugh Tale and discovering the truth about the world, which aligns with his distrust of the World Government revealed in this episode.",

    "theoryText": "Based on Kuzan's ice powers demonstrated in this episode and his later association with the Blackbeard Pirates, fans have theorized about symbolic foreshadowing. The ten captains of the Blackbeard Pirates are called 'Titanic Commanders,' and since Kuzan has the Hie Hie no Mi (Ice-Ice Fruit), the theory suggests he will eventually 'sink' all the Titanic commanders with his ice abilities - a reference to the sinking of the Titanic ship in 1912. This theory connects to the philosophical stance Kuzan reveals in this episode about working outside traditional structures.",

Some fans believe this reflection contains a figure that looks like Imu. Combined with Kuzan's statement about not trusting the World Government, the theory proposes that Kuzan's true target is Imu, the secret ruler of the World Government. This theory suggests Kuzan is gathering power and allies to eventually challenge the highest authority in the world.",

Fans predict that Zoro will honor the cultural significance of Shusui that Kin'emon explains and will return it to Wano in exchange for another legendary blade, possibly Enma. This theory suggests that this seemingly minor conflict in episode 625 sets up a major character moment for Zoro later in the series.",
