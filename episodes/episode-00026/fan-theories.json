    "summary": "A popular theory suggests that the All Blue doesn't currently exist, but will be created when the Red Line is destroyed, causing all the seas to merge into one ocean.",
    "fullText": "This theory proposes that the One Piece treasure includes or relates to the Ancient Weapons, which will be used to destroy the Red Line at both Reverse Mountain and the halfway point (Fishman Island/Mary Geoise). When the Red Line is destroyed, the Grand Line, Calm Belt, and all four Blues will converge into a single ocean, creating the legendary All Blue that Sanji and Zeff dream of finding. This would also unite the world's oceans and potentially fulfill Joy Boy's promise to the Fish-Men.",

    "summary": "A theory suggesting that Reverse Mountain, where waters from all four Blues converge, is actually the All Blue.",
    "fullText": "Since Reverse Mountain is the point where water from all four Blues (North, South, East, and West) flows together and meets before entering the Grand Line, some fans theorize this could be the All Blue that Sanji seeks. The convergence of all these waters would technically create a place where fish from all seas meet, fulfilling the definition of the All Blue. However, this theory is considered less likely since the Straw Hats have already passed through Reverse Mountain.",

    "fullText": "This thematic theory suggests that Zeff's sacrifice of his leg and his pirate career to ensure Sanji could pursue the All Blue represents a recurring theme in One Piece: the passing of dreams from one generation to the next. Just as Shanks sacrificed his arm for Luffy, and Zeff sacrificed his leg for Sanji, the series explores how the older generation enables the younger generation to achieve what they could not. This theme extends to Roger and Luffy, Whitebeard and Ace, and many others throughout the series.",
