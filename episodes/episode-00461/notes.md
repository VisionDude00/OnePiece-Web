**Japanese Title:** 決戦の幕開け！ エースと白ひげの過去 (Kessen no Makuake! Ēsu to Shirohige no Kako)
**Air Date:** August 8, 2010 (Japan), August 7, 2010 (US Funimation)
**Arc:** Marineford Arc
**Saga:** Summit War Saga

## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
1. **One Piece Wiki (Fandom)** - Primary source for episode details, character information, and plot summary
2. **IMDb** - Episode rating and Japanese title verification
3. **Behind The Voice Actors** - Voice actor information
4. **Comic Vine** - Secondary verification of episode information
5. **Wikipedia** - Season and broadcast information
6. **Multiple reaction videos** - External media documentation

### Script Availability
**Issue:** Could not locate a full episode script or transcript for Episode 461. The search results indicated that fan transcript databases exist (Forever Dreaming, TvT, etc.) but did not provide direct access to Episode 461's specific script.

**Impact:** Timestamps for events are estimated based on typical episode pacing and plot progression described in wiki sources. Exact dialogue quotes are limited to those documented in wiki sources and fan discussions.

**Mitigation:** Used detailed plot summaries from One Piece Wiki and cross-referenced with multiple sources to ensure accuracy of events and their approximate timing.

## Key Findings

### Major Events Documented
1. **Whitebeard's Power Reveal** - First full demonstration of Gura Gura no Mi at Marineford
2. **Tsunami Creation** - Whitebeard creates twin tsunamis threatening to destroy Marineford
3. **Aokiji's Counter** - Admiral freezes the tsunamis with Hie Hie no Mi
4. **Ace's Backstory** - Extensive flashback showing:
   - Ace as captain of Spade Pirates
   - Five-day battle with Jinbe
   - Whitebeard defeating the Spade Pirates
   - Ace's assassination attempts on Whitebeard
   - Ace becoming Second Division Commander
   - Meeting with Shanks
   - Blackbeard murdering Thatch
   - Ace's decision to pursue Blackbeard
5. **Father-Son Moment** - Whitebeard taking full responsibility for Ace

### Animation Error Noted
The episode contained an animation error where Shanks appears with both arms during his meeting with Ace, despite having lost his left arm years earlier. This was reportedly corrected in the home release.

### Production Details
- **Screenplay:** Jin Tanaka
- **Art Direction:** Miho Shiraishi
- **Animation:** Yukiko Nakatani
- **Director:** Sumio Watanabe
- **Storyboard:** Naoyuki Itō

### Manga Adaptation
Episode 461 adapts:
- Chapter 551, pages 17-19
- Chapter 552, pages 2-15

## Uncertainties and Questions

### Timestamp Precision
**Issue:** Without access to the actual episode or a detailed script, timestamps are approximated based on:
- Typical One Piece episode structure (opening ~2:00, story begins ~3:00)
- Standard pacing for flashback sequences
- Logical flow of events as described in plot summaries

**Confidence Level:** Medium - Timestamps are likely accurate within 30-60 seconds but should be verified against actual episode viewing.

### Voice Actor Completeness
**Note:** Voice actor lists may be incomplete. I documented major characters appearing in this episode, but there may be additional minor characters or background Marines/pirates with speaking roles that aren't captured.

### Missing Information
1. **Exact runtime** - Not specified in sources
2. **Key animator names** - Production credits don't include specific key animators
3. **Detailed ending song information** - Episode 461 falls in the range where ending themes were omitted (Episodes 279-1070)
4. **Some English voice actors** - Couldn't confirm English VAs for all characters (e.g., Thatch)

### Debut vs. First Appearance
**Spade Pirates:** Listed as debuting in Episode 461, though they are shown in flashback. This is technically their first appearance in the anime, even though the events depicted occurred in the past within the story's timeline.

## External Media Findings

### YouTube/Video Reactions
Found 7 reaction/review videos covering Episode 461:
- Most are multi-episode reactions (459-463 range)
- Focused on Whitebeard's entrance and power display
- Several are Patreon-exclusive content
- Limited engagement metrics available

### Articles and Podcasts
**Issue:** Could not locate specific articles or podcast episodes dedicated solely to Episode 461. Most editorial content focuses on:
- The Marineford Arc as a whole
- Later episodes with more dramatic moments
- General analysis of Whitebeard's character

This is likely because Episode 461, while important, is primarily setup and flashback rather than a climactic moment.

### Fan Theories
Found limited episode-specific theories. Most Marineford theories focus on:
- What-if scenarios (Prime Whitebeard)
- Strategic decisions by characters
- The Will of D mystery

2. **Check the home release** to document the corrected animation error regarding Shanks' arm
3. **Search Japanese fan communities** for additional theories and discussions not available in English

**Researcher Notes:**
This episode is crucial for understanding the Whitebeard-Ace relationship and the emotional weight of the Marineford War. The flashbacks provide essential context that makes later events in the arc significantly more impactful. The episode balances action (Whitebeard's power display) with character development (Ace's journey) effectively, making it one of the stronger episodes in the arc's buildup phase.

The incremental approach worked well for this episode - focusing only on what's revealed here rather than trying to build complete character profiles. Future episodes will fill in additional details about these characters and events.
