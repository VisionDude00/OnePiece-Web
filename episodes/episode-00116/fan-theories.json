    "theoryTitle": "Sanji's Weakness: Chivalry vs. Libido",
    "theoryText": "The fan theory proposes that Sanji's inability to fight Mr. 2 while transformed into Nami reveals that his weakness isn't truly about chivalry or refusing to fight women. The evidence cited is that Mr. 2 Bon Clay is most certainly NOT a woman - an okama perhaps, but not a woman. Yet Sanji was completely paralyzed upon Mr. 2's transformation into Nami, while he had no problem smashing Usopp's face without hesitation. The theory concludes that the driving force behind Sanji's actions isn't his chivalry, but his libido - he can't fight pretty people who appear female, regardless of their actual gender. This distinction becomes important because it's not the fact that Sanji can't fight women, it's that he can't fight pretty ones.",

    "theoryTitle": "Mr. 2's Devil Fruit Combat Limitation Intentional Design",
    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that the Mane Mane no Mi's inability to allow proper combat techniques while transformed is an intentional balancing mechanism by Oda. If Mr. 2 could copy both appearance AND maintain his full Okama Kenpo mastery, the fruit would be too powerful for espionage and combat combined. The limitation forces users to choose between deception (staying transformed) or combat effectiveness (reverting to original form). This creates interesting tactical decisions in battle and prevents the fruit from being overpowered. The theory suggests this is why Mr. 2 developed such a strong martial arts style in the first place - to compensate for the times when he must fight in his true form.",

    "theoryTitle": "The Fight Foreshadows Sanji's Enies Lobby Failure",
    "theoryText": "This theory posits that Episode 116's fight between Sanji and Mr. 2 intentionally foreshadows Sanji's critical failure at Enies Lobby against Kalifa. In Episode 116, Sanji wins despite his weakness being exploited because he finds a clever workaround (exploiting Mr. 2's transformation mechanics). However, this establishes that Sanji's chivalry can be weaponized against him. The theory suggests Oda planted this seed early to make Sanji's later complete inability to fight Kalifa more believable and tragic - showing that there are situations where no clever trick can overcome his fundamental principles. The progression from 'nearly defeated but finds a way' to 'completely defeated, no way out' demonstrates character consistency and raises the stakes for how this weakness impacts the crew.",

    "theoryText": "Fans noted that Sanji's respectful treatment of Mr. 2 after defeating him ('Thanks for the good fight' and sparing him) was unusual and specific. This theory suggests this moment was intentionally written to establish mutual respect that would pay off in Impel Down when Mr. 2 sacrifices himself to help Luffy. The theory argues that small moments of honor between enemies in One Piece often foreshadow future alliances or redemption arcs. Sanji recognizing Mr. 2 as a worthy opponent and choosing mercy planted the seeds for Mr. 2's eventual heroic turn and the friendship between Mr. 2 and the Straw Hats.",
