    "theoryTitle": "Oars Created Wano as a Patchwork Country",
    "theoryText": "According to Vivre Card Databook information, Oars created a country of ruffians by piecing several countries together. This country is rumored to still exist and could potentially be Wano. Oars died at the age of 159, meaning he was born around 700 to 800 years ago, right after the Void Century. Some fans theorize that Joyboy, Oars, and Zunesha were friends who likely shared sake and became brothers, which would explain connections between these ancient figures.",

    "theoryText": "Fans speculate about why Gecko Moria and Kaido went to Wano, and why Little Oars Jr. was on Wano with Ace. The theory suggests it's because the 'continent pullers' (Oni giants like Oars) created Wano as a patchwork country by pulling different landmasses together. This would explain the historical connection between the Oars lineage and Wano.",

The theory posits that while Oars is entertaining when compared to his intended purpose, he's not actually as unstoppable as Moria believes, which may explain why Moria lost to Kaido in the past despite having access to powerful zombies.",

    "theoryText": "Based on Episode 351's revelation that shadows carry personalities and memories, fans theorize that in the One Piece world, shadows may be connected to souls or life force. This could explain why people without shadows die in sunlight - they've lost a fundamental part of their being. The fading of shadow memories over time might represent the gradual erosion of the original person's essence, suggesting that zombies are imperfect vessels for consciousness transfer.",
