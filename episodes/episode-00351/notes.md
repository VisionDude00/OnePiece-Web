## Research Process

### Scripts and Transcripts
**BLOCKER:** Unable to find a complete, official episode script or transcript. Full episode transcripts are copyrighted material and not readily available through official sources.

**Workaround:** Used multiple sources including:
- One Piece Wiki episode summary
- Fan recaps and reviews (Adult Swim Squad blog)
- Character wiki pages for dialogue quotes
- Episode reviews and reactions for scene details

### Key Research Findings

1. **Voice Acting Detail:** Oars is voiced by the same actors as Luffy (Mayumi Tanaka in Japanese, Colleen Clinkenbeard in English) because he has Luffy's shadow and personality. This is a creative production choice that reinforces the shadow transfer concept.

2. **Opening Song:** "Jungle P" by 5050 (episodes 326-372). The "P" stands for "Party." This was the 9th opening theme.

3. **No Ending Song:** One Piece stopped using ending songs after episode 279, so Episode 351 has no ending theme.

4. **Animation Quality:** Standard quality episode. No special sakuga moments noted in reviews.

5. **TV Rating:** 6.4% rating in Japan (Rank 8 in timeslot) - solid performance.

## Key Story Elements

### Shadow Personality Transfer Mechanics
- Shadows carry the original person's personality and memories
- These personality traits and memories gradually fade over time
- Oars exhibits this - knows Sanji's name but doesn't remember who he is
- Shadows can be forced to obey through Moria's power
- Strong-willed shadows (like Luffy's) can resist commands even in zombie form

### Oars' Luffy-Like Behavior
1. Immediately yells for meat upon awakening
2. Calls for Sanji to cook
3. Declares dream to become Pirate King
4. Refuses to follow orders (independent spirit)
5. Expects his arm to stretch (inherited Luffy's body expectations)
6. Shows confusion when body doesn't behave like rubber

## Notable Quotes

**Oars:**
- "MEEEEEEAAAAAATTTTTT!!! I'M HUNNNNGGRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!" (First words)
- "Sanji! Make me some food! ...Wait, who's Sanji?"
- "I'm not going to be anyone's underling!"
- "I'm going to become the Pirate King!"
- "Huh? My arm should have stretched!"

**Gecko Moria:**
- "No matter how much the shadow struggles, it will obey me!"

**Chopper:**
- "Dr. Hogback is the one making the zombies! They steal personalities with the shadows inside them. Hogback is using people like pawns!"

**Absalom:**
- "You'll make a perfect bride, Nami!"

## Timestamp Estimates

Since no official script with exact timestamps was found, timestamps were estimated based on:
- Standard 24-minute episode structure
- Typical One Piece pacing (opening at 2:00, story starts ~3:00)
- Scene descriptions from recaps
- General arc progression knowledge

Timestamps should be considered approximate within ±30 seconds.

## Observations

### Episode Themes:
1. **Identity and Self:** Who is Oars - the ancient giant or Luffy's shadow?
2. **Dreams and Ambition:** Luffy's dream transcends physical form
3. **Loss of Agency:** Shadow theft, forced resurrection, kidnapping
4. **Comedy vs. Horror:** Balance of Luffy's comedic personality in horrifying giant zombie

### Story Significance:
- This episode represents the turning point where Moria's plan reaches its peak
- Oars refusing orders shows the limitation of Moria's power
- The comedy of Oars acting like Luffy contrasts with the horror of the situation
- Sets up the major confrontations to come

### Production Notes:
- Slower pacing (only 15 manga pages adapted)
- Extended reaction shots and character moments
- Focus on establishing Oars' personality

## Questions for Review

1. Should we include more voice actors for minor characters (Perona, Hogback, etc.)?
2. Are the timestamp estimates acceptable without a full script?
3. Should we add more events for minor character interactions?
4. Is the spoiler severity appropriate for each event?

## Final Notes

This episode is pivotal in the Thriller Bark arc as it introduces the main physical threat (Oars) while also providing crucial world-building about how Moria's shadow powers work. The comedic elements (Oars acting like Luffy) balance the darker themes of body desecration and shadow theft.

The lack of an official script was the main blocker, but by combining multiple secondary sources (wiki summaries, fan recaps, character pages), I was able to construct a comprehensive picture of the episode's events and significance.
