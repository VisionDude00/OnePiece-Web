The theory suggests that Luffy watched CP9 use their Rokushiki techniques, particularly Soru (Shave), and then applied what he observed to his own abilities. Luffy's learning style involves copying techniques from opponents and adapting them to work with his Devil Fruit powers.",

The theory argues that Gear 2's introduction was perfectly paced, narratively earned through Luffy's defeat by Aokiji, and delivered without excessive fanfare. This makes it feel more organic and satisfying than later power-ups.",
