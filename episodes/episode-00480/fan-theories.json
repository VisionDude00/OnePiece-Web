    "summary": "A theory that Garp deliberately allowed himself to be defeated by Luffy, choosing family over duty while maintaining the appearance of having done his job as a Marine.",
    "fullText": "Many fans theorize that Garp intentionally took Luffy's punch and allowed himself to fall, rather than being genuinely defeated. The evidence includes: (1) Garp is significantly stronger than Luffy at this point in the series, (2) The flashback to young Luffy and Ace occurring right before he falls suggests internal deliberation, (3) Garp's conflicted expressions throughout the confrontation, and (4) His statement 'If you want to pass, you'll have to kill me' which could be interpreted as giving Luffy permission. This theory suggests Garp made a conscious choice to prioritize his grandsons over his Marine duty, while maintaining plausible deniability by appearing to have been defeated in combat.",

    "fullText": "Fans have debated what exactly Mr. 3's original plan was when he disguised himself as one of Ace's executioners. Some theories suggest: (1) He planned to use his wax powers to create a protective shield during the execution, (2) He intended to create a wax duplicate of Ace and swap them at the last moment, (3) He was waiting for the right moment to act but didn't have a concrete plan, or (4) He was simply trying to be in position to help however possible. The fact that he appeared to be going through with execution motions before Luffy arrived suggests he either had a sophisticated plan or was improvising. His quick creation of the wax key demonstrates his ability to think on his feet.",

    "fullText": "This theory, which gained traction after later manga events, suggests that Oda deliberately created parallels between Garp and Ace's situations. Just as Ace was captured and scheduled for execution at Marineford with Garp torn between duty and family, Garp later finds himself in a similar position of captivity. The theory posits that: (1) Both characters are imprisoned due to their connections and choices, (2) Both situations force others to make difficult decisions about rescue, (3) Garp's decision to allow Luffy to pass in Episode 480 foreshadows his own understanding of choosing family over duty, and (4) The parallel demonstrates the cyclical nature of the One Piece world and the consequences of the World Government's actions. This theory suggests Oda was setting up long-term narrative symmetry.",

    "fullText": "This popular fan theory speculates about an alternate timeline where Luffy awakens Gear 5 during the Marineford War instead of Conqueror's Haki. The theory suggests: (1) With Gear 5's power, Luffy could have defeated Admiral Akainu, preventing Ace's death, (2) The awakened abilities would have given Luffy the strength to fight Admirals on equal footing, (3) The cartoonish reality-bending powers could have protected Ace from the fatal attack, and (4) However, this would have fundamentally altered Luffy's character development and removed crucial motivations for the timeskip. Most fans acknowledge this theory is more of a 'what if' scenario than a realistic possibility, as Luffy wasn't ready for such power at that point, and Ace's death was narratively necessary for Luffy's growth.",

    "fullText": "This theory explores the question of whether Garp actually betrayed the Marines by allowing Luffy to pass. Arguments for betrayal include: (1) He deliberately failed to stop Luffy despite having the power to do so, (2) His actions directly contributed to Ace's temporary rescue, undermining the execution, (3) He chose family over his duty as a Marine Vice Admiral, and (4) His intervention allowed the Whitebeard Pirates' mission to succeed momentarily. However, counterarguments suggest: (1) Garp maintained plausible deniability by appearing to be defeated, (2) He didn't directly attack his fellow Marines, (3) The World Government never punished him, suggesting they understood his position, and (4) His actions could be seen as a father/grandfather's understandable emotional weakness rather than deliberate treason. The theory suggests Garp walked a fine line between duty and family, and his choice had lasting implications for his relationship with the Marines.",
