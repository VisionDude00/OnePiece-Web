# Research Notes for Episode 480

## Episode Overview
**Title:** "Each on Different Paths! Luffy vs. Garp!" (それぞれの選んだ道 ルフィVSガープ！)
**Air Date:** December 19, 2010 (Japan), December 18, 2010 (US Simulcast)
**Manga Chapter:** Chapter 571 "The Execution Platform" (pages 2-17)
**IMDb Rating:** 9.6/10 with ~8,000 votes

## Research Process

### Sources Found
- ✅ One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Comprehensive episode and character information
- ✅ IMDb - Rating and user reviews
- ✅ Behind The Voice Actors - Voice actor credits
- ✅ Multiple analysis articles (Game Rant, Collider, FandomWire, Screen Rant)
- ✅ Fan reactions (Streamable, Bilibili, Patreon, Tumblr)
- ❌ No complete episode script/transcript found (relied on summaries and wiki)

### Challenges Encountered

1. **No Complete Script Available**: Could not locate a full episode transcript. Relied on detailed wiki summaries and video descriptions to reconstruct events and dialogue.

2. **Timestamp Estimation**: Without access to the actual episode video or detailed script, timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and event sequences. These should be verified against the actual episode.

3. **Limited Direct Quotes**: Due to lack of script, only the most iconic and well-documented quotes could be included. More dialogue exists in the episode that could be added with script access.

4. **Voice Actor Verification**: Some English dub voice actors were harder to verify. Relied on Behind The Voice Actors database which may not be 100% complete for all minor characters.
