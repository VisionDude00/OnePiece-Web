    "theoryText": "The Pumpkin Pirates create an ontological paradox by becoming the very Marines who chased the Straw Hat Pirates to Ruluka Island. After escaping the Rainbow Mist and being thrown back in time fifty years, they were rescued by Marines and eventually joined the force. This means they were pursuing themselves in a time loop - the adult Marines who brought the Straw Hats to Ruluka were the same children who the Straw Hats helped rescue from the Rainbow Mist.",

    "title": "Rainbow Mist as a Temporal Prison",
    "theoryText": "The Rainbow Mist functions as an unintentional temporal prison where time flows at a different rate than the outside world. People trapped inside experience only days or weeks while decades pass outside. The space loop property ensures that those inside cannot escape - any attempt to leave just brings them back to their starting point. This explains why ships and their crews have been accumulating in Ape's Concert for potentially centuries, creating the ship graveyard. The phenomenon may be natural or could be a remnant of ancient technology.",

    "title": "Continuity Issue: Straw Hats Forget Time Travel",
    "theoryText": "The Ruluka Island Arc creates a continuity issue because the Straw Hats experience time travel when they encounter the Pumpkin Pirates (who were displaced in time) and witness the temporal effects of the Rainbow Mist. However, in the canonical Wano Country Arc, the Straw Hats are surprised and confused by the concept of time travel when they meet Momonosuke and learn about Toki's abilities. This suggests either: 1) The Straw Hats don't consider the Rainbow Mist incident as 'true' time travel, 2) They forgot about it, or 3) The filler arc is simply non-canon and doesn't affect their knowledge in the main story.",
