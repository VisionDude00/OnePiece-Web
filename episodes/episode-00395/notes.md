## Episode: "Time Limit - The Human Auction Begins"

### Research Date
December 5, 2025

### Overview
Episode 395 is a pivotal setup episode in the Sabaody Archipelago arc, introducing the human auction house and several key antagonists while building tension for the explosive events in episodes 396-397.

### Research Process

#### Sources Used
- One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Primary source for episode details, character information, and plot summary
- Behind The Voice Actors - Voice actor information
- CBR Article - IMDb ratings and episode rankings
- Hogan Reviews - Arc review and critical analysis
- Tumblr blog - First-time viewer perspective
- Wikipedia - Season 11 information
- Quora discussions - Fan theories about Rayleigh

#### Key Findings

1. **Historical Significance**: This is the first episode to use "Share the World" by TVXQ as the opening theme, marking a significant change in the series' musical identity.

2. **Broadcasting Context**: Episode 395 was the first One Piece episode broadcast within the "Dream 9" Sunday morning programming block alongside Dragon Ball Kai's premiere, indicating a shift in Toei's programming strategy.

3. **Multiple Storylines**: The episode effectively juggles three major plot threads:
   - The Straw Hats' attempt to rescue Camie at the auction house
   - The announcement of Ace's execution spreading across Sabaody
   - Garp learning about Rayleigh at the auction and choosing not to intervene

4. **Character Debuts**: Five new characters debut in this episode:
   - Disco (the auctioneer)
   - Saint Charlos (Celestial Dragon)
   - Saint Rosward (Celestial Dragon)
   - Saint Shalria (Celestial Dragon)
   - Peterman (kidnapper gang leader)

5. **Thematic Weight**: The episode confronts heavy themes of slavery, dehumanization, and corrupt authority. The slave pricing system shown to Sanji is particularly disturbing and sets up the moral outrage that drives the crew's actions in the next episode.

### Events Documented
Total Events: 11

- 2 World Lore events (Ace's execution, Rayleigh at auction)
- 2 Location Arrival events
- 2 Major Decision events
- 4 First Appearance events
- 1 Cultural Moment event

Severity Distribution:
- Critical: 2 events (Ace's execution announcement, Celestial Dragons arrival)
- Major: 7 events
- Minor: 2 events

### Notable Quotes
The episode features several important character-defining quotes:
- X Drake's prediction of war
- Garp's assessment of Rayleigh's danger
- Nami's declaration that money doesn't matter for saving friends
- Eustass Kid's cynical philosophy about authority and crime

### Character Development Highlights

**Nami**: Shows significant growth by prioritizing friendship over money, a reversal of her typical character trait. This demonstrates how far she's come since joining the crew.

**Garp**: Displays tactical wisdom by choosing not to engage Rayleigh while the Marines prepare for war with Whitebeard. This shows the burden of his position and the strategic calculations he must make.

**Eustass Kid**: His cynical observations about corrupt authority establish his worldview and set him up as a philosophical foil to Luffy.

### Production Notes

**Animation Director**: Yutaka Nakashima
**Screenplay**: Yoshiyuki Suga
**Art Director**: Miho Shiraishi
**Key Animator**: Shigefumi Shingaki

The episode corresponds to One Piece manga Chapter 501 (pages 2-19).

### IMDb Rating
7.9/10 - One of the lower-rated episodes in the highly-acclaimed Sabaody Archipelago arc, likely because it's primarily setup for the explosive events in episodes 396-397.

### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Script Access**: Could not find a complete episode script, so had to rely on wiki summaries and video analyses for detailed event sequencing.

2. **Timestamp Estimation**: Without direct access to the episode, timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and event sequencing. These should be considered approximate (+/- 1-2 minutes).

3. **External Media Limitations**: Limited YouTube reaction videos were found specifically for episode 395 alone - most reactions cover episodes 395-396 together due to the connected nature of the story.

4. **Voice Actor Information**: Some minor character voice actors (particularly for English dub) could not be verified and were omitted rather than including uncertain information.

### Quality Checklist Review

✅ Episode metadata complete (title, dates, arc, saga)
✅ Opening song information verified (Share the World debut)
✅ No ending song (ending themes omitted from episode 279 onwards)
✅ 11 events documented with timestamps

### Observations

1. **Setup Episode**: Episode 395 is primarily a setup episode, building tension and establishing the pieces for the climactic events of episode 396 (Luffy punching Saint Charlos). This explains its lower IMDb rating compared to the more action-packed episodes in the arc.

2. **World-Building**: The episode excels at world-building, showing multiple locations (Sabaody, Marine Headquarters) and multiple perspectives (Straw Hats, Marines, Supernovas) to create a sense of a living, breathing world.

3. **Moral Weight**: The auction house scenes carry significant moral weight, forcing viewers to confront the reality of slavery in the One Piece world. The dehumanizing pricing system and the casual cruelty of the Celestial Dragons create genuine outrage.

4. **Convergence**: Multiple plot threads and character groups converge on the auction house (Straw Hats, Kid Pirates, Heart Pirates, Celestial Dragons), setting up the powder keg that will explode in the next episode.

5. **Foreshadowing**: The announcement of Ace's execution in this episode foreshadows the Marineford War arc and sets up events that will span over 100 episodes.

### Future Research Suggestions

1. **Episode Script**: If a complete episode script becomes available, timestamps should be verified and updated for accuracy.

2. **Additional External Media**: More YouTube reactions, podcast episodes, and Reddit discussions may exist but were not found in the initial search. Future researchers should check:
   - The One Piece Podcast archives
   - Grand Line Review video analyses
   - Reddit r/OnePiece episode discussion threads (may need to search by date: April 2009 for Japan, July 2015 for US)

3. **Voice Actors**: Some English voice actors for minor characters could not be verified. Future research could check Funimation's official credits or Behind The Voice Actors for complete information.

4. **Production Details**: Additional production details (assistant directors, in-between animators, etc.) could be added if official Toei Animation credits become available.

### Personal Notes

This episode represents a turning point in the One Piece anime, where the series begins to tackle darker, more mature themes head-on. The Sabaody Archipelago arc marks a shift from the more lighthearted adventure of the earlier arcs to the heavier, more consequential events of the Summit War Saga.

The Celestial Dragons are introduced as perhaps the most irredeemable antagonists in the entire series, embodying systemic oppression and unchecked authority. Their presence creates a moral imperative that even the usually carefree Luffy cannot ignore, setting up one of the series' most cathartic moments in the next episode.

The parallel storyline of Ace's execution announcement shows Oda's masterful narrative structure, weaving together multiple plot threads that will all come to fruition in the Marineford arc. X Drake's immediate understanding of the implications demonstrates the level of political awareness among the Worst Generation pirates.

Episode 395 may not be the most exciting episode of the arc, but it's essential for setting up the dominoes that will fall in the episodes to come. It's a masterclass in building tension and creating moral stakes that resonate with the audience.
