    "summary": "A theory that Silvers Rayleigh intentionally allowed himself to be captured and sold at the auction house specifically to meet Monkey D. Luffy, having heard about him and wanting to evaluate Roger's spiritual successor.",
    "fullText": "While it's confirmed that Rayleigh had a scheme of getting himself captured to rob his buyers, some fans theorize that his presence at this particular auction was not coincidental. Given his later comment 'I wanted to meet you, Monkey D. Luffy,' some believe Rayleigh may have intentionally timed his capture to coincide with the Straw Hats' presence at Sabaody. This would demonstrate impressive foresight and planning on Rayleigh's part, as well as his interest in Luffy as someone who reminds people of Roger.",

    "summary": "A theory that the World Government's true intention in executing Ace publicly is not just to provoke Whitebeard, but also to draw out Monkey D. Dragon, the Revolutionary Army leader and Luffy's father.",
    "fullText": "When news of Ace's execution spreads in episode 395, some fans theorized that the World Government had multiple objectives. While provoking Whitebeard was obvious, the public execution could also be designed to draw out Dragon, who might intervene to save his son's brother or to rescue Luffy if he showed up. This would explain the massive military buildup - they were preparing to face multiple legends at once. The theory suggests the Marines knew about Luffy and Ace's connection and were hoping to eliminate multiple threats in one stroke.",
