    "summary": "After Episode 572 revealed the Tamate Box contains explosives, fans theorized that when Big Mom opens it, the explosion would weaken her by causing her to lose consumed souls, providing Luffy an opportunity to escape or defeat her.",
    "fullText": "Since the conclusion of the Fish-Man Island Arc in Episode 572, it was foreshadowed that Big Mom would be subject to the Tamate Box's explosion once opened. Fans theorized this wasn't just a comedic plot point but a deliberate setup by Oda. The theory suggested that when Big Mom opens the treasure box expecting candy, the bomb would explode and cause her to lose some of the souls she consumed through her Devil Fruit power, temporarily weakening her. This would create an opening for Luffy and his allies during their inevitable confrontation. While the theory was partially correct about the bomb playing a crucial role, what actually happened was even more dramatic - the bomb toppled the Whole Cake Chateau during the wedding, coincidentally saving the Straw Hat-Firetank-Germa alliance from execution.",

    "summary": "Fans theorized that the Tamate Box explosion would be interpreted by Big Mom as a deliberate declaration of war from Luffy, forcing a confrontation between the Straw Hats and one of the Four Emperors.",
    "fullText": "Episode 572 explicitly showed Neptune and the Minister of the Right worrying that when Big Mom opens the booby-trapped Tamate Box, the explosion will appear to be a deliberate act of war from Luffy. This led fans to theorize that this would be the catalyst for the Whole Cake Island arc, forcing Luffy into a direct conflict with an Emperor before he was ready. The theory suggested Oda was setting up a situation where Luffy would have to face consequences for his actions on Fish-Man Island, even though giving the bomb was unintentional. While a confrontation did happen during the Whole Cake Island arc, it was triggered by Sanji's arranged marriage rather than the Tamate Box itself, though the box's explosion did occur during the climactic tea party scene.",

    "summary": "After Episode 572 showed Jinbe deciding to leave Big Mom's protection, fans theorized this would create a dangerous situation for the Sun Pirates and potentially force them into conflict with Big Mom's crew.",
    "fullText": "Episode 572 revealed Jinbe's intention to sever ties with Big Mom to join the Straw Hats, which immediately raised concerns among fans about the safety of the Sun Pirates. The theory suggested that Big Mom, known for her volatile nature and strict control over her territory, would not take kindly to Jinbe's departure. Fans speculated this could lead to: (1) Big Mom attacking the Sun Pirates as punishment, (2) Jinbe having to perform a dangerous task to safely leave her service, or (3) The Sun Pirates being forced to fight Big Mom's crew to protect their former captain. This theory proved accurate, as later arcs showed Jinbe having to leave a sake cup with Big Mom and the Sun Pirates being endangered, ultimately leading to their appearance during the Whole Cake Island arc where they helped the Straw Hats escape.",
