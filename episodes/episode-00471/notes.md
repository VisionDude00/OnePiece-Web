4. **Power Scaling:** Shows how outmatched the allied pirates are against Marine technology

### Cultural Context

## Challenges & Questions

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **No Full Script Available:** Had to reconstruct events from plot summaries and wiki information
2. **Limited Recent External Media:** Most reactions/analyses are 2-3+ years old
3. **Exact Timestamps Unknown:** Had to estimate timestamps based on typical episode pacing
4. **Voice Actor Completeness:** Not all VAs for minor characters could be confirmed
5. **Fan Theories Scarcity:** Episode is 14+ years old, specific theories hard to find

### Questions for Review:
1. Should I include more minor characters (Marco, Jozu, Vista) in characters.json even though their moments are brief?
2. Timestamp accuracy - estimates vs exact (would require watching episode directly)
3. Should I create separate files for devil fruits, crews, or techniques even if empty?
