    "summary": "Fans theorized that Robin's refusal to return to the crew was motivated by her knowledge of the Buster Call - a devastating fleet attack that CP9 threatened to use on the Straw Hats. Her sacrifice was an act of love to save her friends.",
    "fullText": "Many fans discussed how Robin's decision to leave the crew wasn't a betrayal, but a noble sacrifice. When CP9 threatened to call a Buster Call on the Straw Hats (thanks to Aokiji's permission), Robin knew she had to comply to protect her friends. Her statement that she 'cannot accomplish her wish while staying with them' was actually referring to her wish for them to escape Water 7 safely. This theory was widely discussed in forums and highlighted Robin's character development from a loner to someone willing to sacrifice everything for her nakama.",
