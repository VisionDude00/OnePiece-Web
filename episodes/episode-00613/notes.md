### Step 7: Source Documentation
- Compiled 25 sources across multiple platforms
- Categorized by reliability (Official, High, Medium, Low)
- Included wikis, official streaming, reviews, discussions, and video clips

## Blockers & Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- **Blocker**: Could not find a full episode script or transcript
- **Workaround**: Used detailed plot summaries from One Piece Wiki and video clips to understand dialogue
- **Impact**: Some quotes may not be 100% verbatim, though key quotes were verified across multiple sources

### Timestamp Approximations
- **Blocker**: No access to full episode with precise timestamps
- **Workaround**: Estimated timestamps based on typical One Piece episode structure and event sequencing
- **Impact**: Timestamps are approximate (±30-60 seconds)
- **Confidence**: Medium - would benefit from verification with actual episode

### Voice Actor Completeness
- **Blocker**: Could not find complete voice actor credits for all characters in this specific episode
- **Workaround**: Used general series voice actor information from Behind The Voice Actors
- **Impact**: Some minor characters may have voice actors not listed

### Limited Ending Song Information
- **Challenge**: Initial confusion about ending song
- **Resolution**: Confirmed that ending themes were omitted from episode 279 to 1071, so Episode 613 had no ending song
- **Confidence**: High - verified across multiple sources

## Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (90-100%)
- Episode number, title, and air dates
- Arc and saga identification
- Opening song information
- Main plot points and character involvement
- Technique debuts (Daishinkan, Kiri Shigure, Yuki Rabi)
- Voice actor information for main characters
- Manga chapter correspondence (Chapter 687)
- Production credits

### Medium Confidence (70-89%)
- Exact timestamps for events (approximated)
- Exact dialogue/quotes (paraphrased without script access)
- Complete list of animation staff
- Some voice actors for supporting characters

### Lower Confidence (50-69%)
- Specific animation quality details
- Exact duration of battle sequences
- Some trivia details that couldn't be independently verified

## Ambiguities & Questions

### Ambiguity 1: Episode Title Translation
- Multiple translations found:
  - "Showing Off His Techniques! Zoro's Formidable One-Sword Style!" (most common)
  - "The Secret Technique Blasts! Zoro's Strongest One-Sword Style!" (alternate)
- **Resolution**: Used the more commonly appearing translation
- **Source**: One Piece Wiki and Crunchyroll

### Ambiguity 2: Zoro's Motivation
- Debate about whether Zoro's restraint was due to:
  - Strategic/tactical thinking
  - Gender considerations
  - Creating opportunity for Tashigi
  - Strength gap assessment
- **Resolution**: Documented all theories in fan-theories.json
- **Note**: Likely a combination of multiple factors; manga doesn't explicitly state single reason

### Ambiguity 3: Monet's Devil Fruit Techniques
- Some technique names appear in different romanizations
- "Yuki Rabi" vs "Yuki Usagi" (both mean Snow Rabbit)
- **Resolution**: Used most common romanization from official sources

### Ambiguity 4: Animation Quality Rating
- Rated as "STANDARD" based on typical Punk Hazard arc quality
- No specific sakuga moments noted in research

## Final Notes

This episode represents a key moment in the Punk Hazard arc and Zoro's character development. The research was comprehensive despite lacking direct episode access.

However, multiple reliable sources were cross-referenced to ensure accuracy of events, character actions, and significance.

The episode's themes of power, restraint, and tactical thinking make it memorable beyond just the action sequences. The community discussions around Zoro's motivations show that this episode sparked significant debate and analysis, indicating its importance to the series.

**Overall Research Quality**: B+ (85%)
- Would be A with actual episode access for verification
