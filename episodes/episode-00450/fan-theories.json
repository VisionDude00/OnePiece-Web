    "publishDate": "2022-07-15",
    "theoryText": "After Blackbeard and his crew defeated Magellan in Impel Down (off-screen), they had the opportunity to steal Magellan's extremely powerful Doku Doku no Mi using Blackbeard's unique devil fruit stealing ability. However, they chose not to. This raises the question: why would Blackbeard pass up such a powerful fruit?",
    "evidence": [
      "Blackbeard's crew defeated Magellan severely enough to get him demoted from Chief Warden to Vice Warden",
      "Blackbeard demonstrated the ability to steal devil fruits later at Marineford with Whitebeard's Gura Gura no Mi",
      "The Doku Doku no Mi is extremely powerful - Magellan defeated both Luffy and Blackbeard's entire crew with it",
      "Blackbeard is known for strategic planning and seeking powerful abilities"
    ],
    "proposedExplanations": [
      "Time constraints: Blackbeard was on a tight schedule to reach Marineford before the war ended and couldn't afford delays",
      "Devil fruit stealing cooldown: Blackbeard may have limitations on how frequently he can steal fruits, and he was saving this ability for Whitebeard's more powerful Gura Gura no Mi",
      "Fruit stealing mechanics: The fruit stealing process may require specific conditions (like a particular type of fruit nearby to absorb the devil) that weren't available for Magellan",
      "Magellan wasn't killed: The devil fruit stealing ability may only work on deceased users, and Blackbeard chose to spare Magellan"

    "publishDate": "2024",
    "theoryText": "Magellan's power level is comparable to Marine Admirals - he single-handedly defeated future Emperor Blackbeard and his entire crew, as well as Luffy. The theory questions why such a powerful character remains at Impel Down rather than becoming an Admiral. Some fans theorize his chronic diarrhea and the nature of his poison powers (which could harm allies) make him unsuitable for frontline combat.",

      "Defeated Luffy completely in their first encounter",
      "Defeated the entire Blackbeard Pirates crew",
      "Nearly stopped the entire Impel Down mass breakout single-handedly with Venom Demon",
      "His Doku Doku no Mi is one of the most lethal Devil Fruits shown in the series",
      "Venom Demon technique is powerful enough to destroy all of Impel Down"
    ],
    "proposedExplanations": [
      "His chronic diarrhea limits his operational effectiveness to 4 hours per day",
      "His poison powers are too indiscriminate and would harm allies in large-scale battles",
      "He may prefer the structured environment of Impel Down to active combat duty",
      "The World Government needs someone of his caliber to guard the world's most dangerous criminals",

    "publishDate": null,
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that the Impel Down mass breakout was inevitable due to the World Government's overconfidence in their 'inescapable' prison. By relying too heavily on Magellan as a single point of failure and underestimating the power of cooperation among prisoners, the system had a critical weakness. The escape in Episode 450 represents the consequences of institutional arrogance.",
    "evidence": [
      "The entire security system relied heavily on one person (Magellan)",
      "Level 5.5 existed for years without the government knowing",
      "The prison had never experienced a breakout attempt of this scale",
      "Multiple powerful prisoners (Crocodile, Jinbe, Ivankov) were kept in proximity",
      "The coordination between Luffy's allies (Ivankov's Hell Wink, Jinbe's whale sharks, Mr. 3's wax) showed teamwork could overcome individual strength"
    ],
    "proposedExplanations": [
      "The World Government's hubris made them complacent about security improvements",
      "Keeping all the world's most dangerous criminals in one location created a concentration of power that could be exploited",
