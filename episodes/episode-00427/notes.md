## Final Notes

This episode represents a unique case in One Piece research as it's entirely anime-original promotional content. While it doesn't contribute to the main story, it serves as an interesting example of how Toei Animation creates tie-in content for films. The episode effectively uses nostalgia and callbacks to early arcs while setting up the antagonist and plot device (evolved creatures) for Strong World.

The research was completed successfully despite limited availability of detailed scene breakdowns and fan discussions. All major story elements, character introductions, and thematic content have been documented according to the research methodology.
