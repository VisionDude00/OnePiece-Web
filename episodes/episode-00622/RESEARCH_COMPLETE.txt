RESEARCH CHALLENGES
================================================================================

1. No complete episode script available
   → Used episode summaries and wiki information
   → Timestamps estimated based on typical structure

2. Limited Reddit discussion for older episode
   → Used general fan theory discussions instead

3. Season 16 had no regular ending themes
   → Verified across multiple sources

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Future Updates:
• Add precise timestamps if episode becomes accessible
• Include official character images when available
• Add engagement metrics for external media
• Expand English dub voice actor list
• Add episode script if one becomes available
