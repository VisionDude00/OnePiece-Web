## Plot Summary

Following Jinbe's acceptance as a Shichibukai, the Sun Pirates return to Fish-Man Island as free citizens with amnesty. A few days later, World Noble Donquixote Mjosgard crashes on the island in a wrecked ship, the sole survivor of his journey. He arrogantly demands help while shooting at citizens and ordering his former slaves to return to servitude.

Former slaves of the Sun Pirates, bearing deep trauma from their abuse under the Celestial Dragons, attempt to assassinate Mjosgard. Queen Otohime intervenes, throwing herself in front of the bullets to shield him. She is wounded but saves his life, pleading with her people not to pass hatred to their children.

After recovering, Mjosgard shows no gratitude and instead takes Otohime hostage at gunpoint, declaring her inferior despite being a queen. Just as he threatens to kill her, young Shirahoshi screams in terror for her mother. Her cry summons five massive Sea Kings that emerge near Fish-Man Island, terrifying everyone present.

This is the first manifestation of Shirahoshi's power as the Ancient Weapon Poseidon. Vander Decken IX realizes she is the legendary mermaid princess his ancestor sought his entire life, setting up his future pursuit of her. Hody Jones also witnesses the power, knowledge that will factor into his schemes.

Mjosgard faints from fear of the Sea Kings. After being healed by Aladine, Otohime makes the bold decision to accompany him back to the surface world, seeing this as an opportunity to prove that peaceful coexistence between humans and fish-men is possible.
