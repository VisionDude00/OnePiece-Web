- Found voice actor information from Behind The Voice Actors
- Located several reviews and blog posts about the episode
- Found character-specific wiki pages for all major characters

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Timestamps:** Exact timestamps were difficult to find. Most sources provided general plot summaries without specific time codes. Timestamps were estimated based on typical episode structure and event sequencing.

2. **Episode Scripts:** Unable to locate a full, detailed script for the episode. Relied on plot summaries and wiki descriptions for dialogue and events.

3. **YouTube Content:** Direct YouTube analysis videos specific to episode 545 were not easily searchable through web search. Found references to reaction videos but not comprehensive analysis content from major One Piece YouTubers.

4. **Fan Theories:** Most fan discussion focused on the broader Fish-Man Island arc rather than this specific episode. Theories documented are based on implications of events shown in episode 545.

### Key Research Findings

#### Character Debuts
- **Donquixote Mjosgard:** First appearance in episode 545. This character will undergo one of the most dramatic redemptions in the series, appearing again 340+ episodes later in the Reverie arc.

#### Major Events Documented
1. Sun Pirates return to Fish-Man Island with amnesty (Jinbe becomes Shichibukai)
2. Mjosgard crashes on Fish-Man Island

4. Otohime saves Mjosgard by shielding him
5. Mjosgard takes Otohime hostage
6. **Shirahoshi summons Sea Kings** (First reveal of Poseidon power)

8. Hody Jones witnesses the power
9. Otohime decides to travel to Mary Geoise with Mjosgard

#### Themes Identified
- **Breaking the Cycle of Hatred:** Core theme of the episode
- **Power of Forgiveness:** Otohime's defining character moment
- **Destiny and Ancient Powers:** Shirahoshi's Poseidon reveal

### Voice Actor Notes
- **Mjosgard:** Voiced by Tetsuo Gotō in episode 545, later replaced by Masami Kikuchi from episode 886 onward
- **Jinbe:** Katsuhisa Hōki took over the role after Daisuke Gōri passed away in 2010
- **Otohime:** Michiko Neya (JP), Amanda Lee/AmaLee (EN)

### Animation & Production

- **Screenplay:** Yoshiyuki Suga
- **Art Director:** Miho Shiraishi
- **Animation Director:** Atsuko Kawamura
- **Opening:** "We Go!" by Hiroshi Kitadani (episodes 517-590)
- **Ending:** None (endings were omitted from episodes 279-1070)

### Spoiler Severity Decisions

**ULTRA_SECRET:**
- Shirahoshi's Sea King summoning (Ancient Weapon Poseidon reveal)

**CRITICAL:**
- Otohime saving Mjosgard (defining character moment)

- Vander Decken realizing Shirahoshi's identity

**MAJOR:**

### Connections to Other Episodes

- 568-570: Vander Decken's pursuit of Shirahoshi in present day
- 626: Confirmation of Shirahoshi as Poseidon

### Notable Absences in Research
1. Could not find detailed scene-by-scene breakdown with precise timestamps
2. Limited YouTube video analysis specifically for this episode
3. No dedicated Reddit discussion thread found
4. Episode script unavailable

### Data Quality Assessment
- **Character Information:** HIGH - Comprehensive data from multiple reliable sources
- **Event Documentation:** HIGH - Major events well-documented across sources
- **Timestamps:** MEDIUM - Estimated based on typical pacing
- **Voice Actors:** HIGH - Verified through multiple sources
- **External Media:** MEDIUM - Found several reviews and blogs, limited video content
- **Fan Theories:** MEDIUM - Compiled based on implications and later confirmations

### Research Time
Approximately 1-2 hours of research conducted on December 23, 2025

### Additional Observations

1. **Historical Significance:** This episode contains one of the most important reveals in One Piece - Shirahoshi as Poseidon. The casual way it's presented (a child crying for her mother) belies its massive importance.

2. **Character Arc:** Mjosgard's introduction here sets up a redemption arc that won't pay off for over 300 episodes, showing Oda's long-term planning.

3. **Thematic Depth:** The episode's handling of trauma, hatred, and forgiveness is considered one of the series' most mature and powerful moments.

4. **Animation Quality:** Standard animation quality for the time period. No special sakuga moments noted in sources.

### Recommendations for Future Research
- Check Japanese fan sites for more detailed episode breakdowns
- Review the manga chapters 624-625 directly for additional dialogue
- Search for One Piece podcasts that may have covered the Fish-Man Island arc
- Look for academic or video essay analysis of the arc's themes
