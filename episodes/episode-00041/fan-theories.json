    "theoryText": "The straw hat brings its owners good fortune, and it's the hat's will that is the reason why Luffy has such unnaturally good luck. The hat chooses its owner rather than previous owners choosing to pass it on. When Luffy places the hat on Nami's head, it's not just symbolic - the hat itself recognizes her as worthy and extends its protection to her.",

    "theoryText": "In both the Arlong Park arc and later in Skypiea, Nami draws courage from the straw hat, overcomes her fears by focusing on it and what it represents. Oda intentionally uses Luffy's hat as a catalyst and symbol of Nami's significant character development throughout the series. Each time she holds or wears it, she gains the strength to face her greatest fears.",

This is intentional foreshadowing by Oda showing that Sanji, despite not being a fish-man or having water-based abilities, consistently prioritizes saving Luffy from water-related dangers. This pattern reinforces the crew dynamics where each member has a specific protective role.",
