    "counterEvidence": "Most fans view this as hyperbole from Dagama. The consensus is that while the King Punch is powerful, it's not fast enough to hit a Yonko and likely not powerful enough to defeat one. The attack's one-hour charge time makes it impractical against top-tier opponents who would never allow such preparation.",

This limitation prevents some of the more creative applications fans have theorized. Additionally, barriers are not soundproof, and Bartolomeo must reshape or move barriers to attack, trading protection for offense.",

    "counterEvidence": "The Birdcage covers an entire city, which exceeds the size limitation of Bartolomeo's barriers (50,000 Bari-Baris). Even if he could create a barrier that large, he can only maintain one barrier at a time, and the Birdcage was shown to cut through most defenses. Later in the arc, multiple strong characters working together could barely slow the Birdcage, suggesting Bartolomeo's barrier alone would be insufficient.",

    "counterEvidence": "While the barrier has shown remarkable durability (withstanding the King Punch), the series hasn't conclusively proven it's truly unbreakable. Fans debate whether attacks with Advanced Conqueror's Haki, awakened Devil Fruits, or reality-warping abilities could bypass or break through the barrier. The barrier's limits haven't been fully tested against the absolute strongest characters in the series.",
