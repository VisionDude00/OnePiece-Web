## Researcher Notes
This episode serves as a transitional piece between the Arlong Park conclusion and the Loguetown arc. As a cover story adaptation, it focuses on Buggy's side adventures rather than the main Straw Hat crew. The comedic tone and resolution of Buggy's storyline from his Orange Town defeat make it a satisfying character moment, even if not critically important to the main plot.

The lack of external media and fan theories is expected for an early-series cover story episode. Most One Piece analysis content focuses on major story arcs and recent episodes rather than supplementary content from 2000.
