    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized about Law's motivations for saving Luffy at Marineford. Some believe Law had knowledge of the 'Will of D' and recognized Luffy's importance to the future. Others theorize Law may have had a personal connection to Dragon or the Revolutionary Army. A popular theory suggests Law was moved by Luffy's determination and saw something special in him worth preserving, possibly relating to his own tragic past and desire to oppose the World Government.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Crocodile's actions at Marineford, particularly saving Luffy in episode 487, mark the beginning of a redemption arc for the character. Some believe Crocodile respects strength and ambition, seeing in Luffy a kindred spirit who refused to give up. Others theorize Crocodile may have had a debt to Whitebeard or the Revolutionaries that motivated his protection of Luffy. A darker theory suggests Crocodile wanted to preserve Luffy for his own future plans.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Luffy's X-shaped chest scar from Akainu represents multiple symbolic meanings. Some believe it represents the crossing of paths between Luffy and Ace, with both brothers having sacrificed for each other. Others see it as a mark of Luffy's transition from naive rookie to hardened warrior who has experienced true loss. A popular theory suggests the X marks the 'treasure' of his heart, showing what he values most. The scar's prominent display after the timeskip is theorized to be Luffy's way of honoring Ace's memory and reminder of his promise to become stronger.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 487 shows Koby experiencing visions and hearing 'voices' of dying people, which fans immediately recognized as the awakening of Observation Haki. Theories suggest this traumatic awakening during Marineford would make Koby's Haki particularly powerful, as it was born from empathy and moral conviction rather than combat training. Some fans theorize Koby's Haki may develop in a unique direction focused on sensing emotions and intent rather than just predicting attacks, making him a different type of Marine who can truly understand justice.",
