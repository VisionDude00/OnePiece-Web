The geography features various waterways for ships to pass through, but the icebergs move unnaturally due to Domo Penguins pushing them from underwater. This allows the Accino Family to trap ships between icebergs. Deep within Hyokaido lies Lovely Land, the Accino Family's golden castle headquarters. The name is likely a reference to Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan.",
