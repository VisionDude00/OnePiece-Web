    "summary": "A widespread fan theory/wish that the G-8 Arc should be considered canon due to its exceptional quality, character development, and seamless integration with the story.",
    "fullText": "Many One Piece fans theorize and argue that the G-8 Arc should be retroactively made canon or at least acknowledged in the main story. The arc is so well-written that fans often forget it's filler. It provides meaningful character moments, doesn't contradict canon, and features the canon scene from Chapter 303 about hiring a shipwright. Vice Admiral Jonathan is considered one of the best antagonists in the series despite being anime-only. Fans argue the arc could easily fit into Oda's narrative and even suggest it should be included in the Netflix live-action adaptation.",

    "fullText": "Fans have theorized about the apparent contradiction of Akainu (who believes in Absolute Justice) having Jonathan as his protégé despite Jonathan's laid-back, strategic, and merciful approach to dealing with pirates. The 'Fridge Brilliance' explanation is that despite Jonathan's friendly attitude and lack of viciousness toward pirates, he is simply too competent and effective for even Akainu to dislike. Jonathan's strategic mind and ability to unite his forces makes him valuable regardless of his methods. This theory suggests that even extremists like Akainu must respect results over ideology when it comes to truly talented individuals.",

    "summary": "Theory by Totally Not Mark connecting the pattern of Jaya, Skypiea, Long Ring Long Land, and G-8 to the later Zou arc through thematic and structural parallels.",
    "fullText": "YouTuber Totally Not Mark proposed the 'checkered fate' theory, which draws parallels between the crew's journey through Jaya, Skypiea, Long Ring Long Land, and the anime-only G-8 arc to the much later Zou arc. The theory notes that while G-8 involves the Straw Hats escaping a fortress they accidentally fell into, Zou involves them needing to enter a mysterious city on top of a wandering giant elephant, with inhabitants pretending to keep someone safe. Both arcs involve unusual locations (a Marine fortress surrounded by water vs. a city on a moving elephant), strategic navigation challenges, and dealing with protectors who have their own agenda. This suggests the anime writers may have been foreshadowing narrative patterns that Oda would later use in canon material.",

    "summary": "The canon conversation in Episode 203 about hiring a shipwright serves as subtle foreshadowing for the Going Merry's eventual fate in Water 7.",
    "fullText": "Episode 203 contains a canon scene from Chapter 303 where the Straw Hats discuss allocating 80% of their Skypiea gold to hire a professional shipwright. This decision, paired with the nostalgic flashbacks to their adventures with the Going Merry, serves as emotional foreshadowing for the ship's tragic fate in the Water 7 arc. Usopp's acknowledgment that he's 'a sniper, not a shipwright' and that 'the Merry deserves someone who really knows what they're doing' becomes tragically ironic when they later learn the Merry is beyond repair. The episode's emphasis on the crew's emotional connection to the ship prepares viewers for the heartbreaking farewell at Enies Lobby. This makes the placement of this canon scene within the filler G-8 arc particularly meaningful.",
