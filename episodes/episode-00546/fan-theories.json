    "summary": "Before the reveal in Episode 552, fans debated who was responsible for Queen Otohime's assassination, with theories ranging from human conspiracies to fish-man traitors.",
    "fullText": "When Episode 546 first aired, the identity of Queen Otohime's assassin was not immediately revealed, leading to widespread fan speculation. Popular theories included: (1) Hody Jones being the culprit, with some fans noting the shooter wasn't shown initially because it was someone already introduced; (2) Aladdin as a suspect since he was the first to react after the shooting (following the logic that 'the first person to comment is usually the one who dropped it'); (3) A Celestial Dragon conspiracy theory, with fans questioning whether the World Nobles would 'sit quietly after being shamed' by Otohime; (4) World Government involvement, with some suggesting assassins like Van Auger; (5) Royal advisors orchestrating the assassination. The actual reveal in Episode 552 confirmed that Hody Jones orchestrated the attack, paying a human pirate to set the fires and then shooting Otohime himself during the confusion.",

    "summary": "Fans debated the merits of Queen Otohime's peaceful diplomatic approach versus Fisher Tiger's more militant resistance methods for achieving fish-man liberation.",
    "fullText": "Following Otohime's assassination in Episode 546, fans engaged in extensive discussions comparing her peaceful approach to human-fish-man relations with Fisher Tiger's more militant philosophy. The debate centered on whether Otohime's diplomatic methods were naive given the deep-seated prejudice in the One Piece world, or if her approach represented the only sustainable path to true equality. Some fans argued that Otohime's position as queen gave her privileges that allowed her to advocate for peace, while Tiger's experiences as a former slave made his militant stance more understandable. The discussion also explored how both characters influenced different factions on Fish-Man Island - with Otohime inspiring the royal family and moderate citizens, while Tiger's legacy lived on through Arlong and eventually Hody Jones. Fans noted the tragic irony that Otohime's assassination by a fish-man (Hody Jones) rather than a human demonstrated how hatred had poisoned Fish-Man Island from within.",

    "summary": "Fans analyzed how Vander Decken's marking of Shirahoshi in Episode 546 set up her decade-long imprisonment and shaped her character development.",
    "fullText": "Episode 546 shows Vander Decken IX marking Shirahoshi with his Mato Mato no Mi during the chaos of Otohime's assassination. Fans noted the tragic timing - Shirahoshi experiences two life-altering traumas in the same moment: her mother's death and being marked by a stalker. The marking condemns the young princess to ten years of isolation in the Hard-Shell Tower, as Decken constantly sends weapons, love letters, and other objects toward her. Fan discussions explored how this imprisonment affected Shirahoshi's development, keeping her emotionally stunted and unable to process her grief properly. Some fans theorized that Decken deliberately chose this moment to mark Shirahoshi, taking advantage of her vulnerability and the distraction of the assassination. Others discussed the symbolic parallel between Shirahoshi's physical imprisonment and the emotional imprisonment of Fish-Man Island itself, trapped by cycles of hatred and fear. The marking also raised questions about why Decken was present at Gyoncorde Plaza during the assassination and whether he had any involvement with or knowledge of Hody Jones's plot.",
