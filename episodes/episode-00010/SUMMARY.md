Later, Luffy and Usopp bond on a cliff overlooking the sea, where Luffy reveals he knows Usopp's father Yasopp from Shanks' crew. Their conversation is interrupted when they overhear Klahadore meeting with the hypnotist Jango below - discovering to their horror that Klahadore is actually Captain Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates.
