# Research Notes for Episode 564

## Episode Information
- **Title (EN):** Back to Zero! Earnest Wishes for Luffy!
- **Title (JP):** ゼロに！ルフィへの熱き願い！ (Zero ni! Rufi e no Atsuki Negai!)
- **Air Date:** September 16, 2012 (Japan), September 15, 2012 (US Simulcast)
- **Arc:** Fish-Man Island Arc
- **Manga Chapters:** 642 (p. 15-19), 644 (p. 2-18)

## Research Process

### Step 1: Episode Scripts
- **Primary Sources Used:**
  - One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Comprehensive episode summary
  - Multiple web searches for plot details
  - Cross-referenced manga chapters 642 and 644

- **Challenge:** Could not find a complete word-for-word transcript of the episode. Relied on detailed plot summaries and wiki information instead.

### Step 2: Episode Content Analysis
Successfully identified 12 major events across the episode, including:
1. Hody's childhood flashback (environmental indoctrination)
2. Hody joining Neptune Army
3. Celebration of Otohime's death
4. Energy Steroid theft and production
5. Fukaboshi's "reset to zero" speech (CRITICAL - emotional climax)
6. Luffy's acceptance
7-10. Various battle technique debuts (Franky Fireball, Heavy Gong, etc.)
11. Hody chasing Shirahoshi
12. Luffy's friendship declaration

### Step 3: Character & Entity Data
**Characters with Key Moments:**
- Fukaboshi (emotional anchor of the episode)
- Hody Jones (backstory reveals)
- Luffy (major decisions and declarations)
- Zoro, Franky, Chopper (technique debuts)
- Ikaros Much, Dosun, Hyouzou (minor appearances)

**Locations:**
- Gyoncorde Plaza (main battle location)
- Fish-Man District (flashback location)
- Fish-Man Island (overall setting)

**No Devil Fruit debuts** - Episode focused on backstory and character moments rather than power reveals

### Step 4: External Media Search
**Challenges:**
- Limited YouTube-specific content found for this individual episode
- Most analysis covers the arc as a whole rather than episode 564 specifically
- Found excellent written analysis instead:
  - "Birds of Hermes" blog post on Hody as greatest villain
  - "Blerds Online" defense of Hody
  - "Never Watched One Piece" Tumblr reactions
  - "Hogan Reviews" arc review

**Notable Finding:** Episode 564's themes became MORE relevant and discussed in late 2010s-2020s as discussions of radicalization and environmental racism intensified.

### Step 5: Fan Theories
Identified several major theoretical frameworks:
1. **Hody as real-world radicalization commentary** - CONFIRMED by author intent
2. **Cycle of hatred across generations** - Well-developed and widely accepted
3. **"Reset to zero" as breaking historical grudges** - Thematic analysis
4. **Anime-original Arlong flashback contradiction** - Controversy about added scene

### Step 6: Voice Actors & Staff
**Production Team:**
- Episode Director: Tetsuya Endō
- Animation Director: Masayuki Takagi
- Screenplay: Hirohiko Kamisaka
- Art Director: Ryūji Yoshiike

**Key Voice Actors Confirmed:**
- Hody Jones: Jōji Nakata (JP), Larry Brantley (EN)
- Fukaboshi: Kentarō Itō (JP), Jarrod Greene (EN)
- Hody (Young): Kōichi Tōchika (JP)

## Notable Findings

### Thematic Significance
This episode is arguably one of the most thematically important in the Fish-Man Island Arc:
- The "Nothing" revelation makes Hody unique among One Piece villains
- Fukaboshi's speech represents the arc's emotional and philosophical climax
- The "reset to zero" concept is a mature take on breaking cycles of hatred

### Animation Quality
Episode used standard TV animation quality - no special sakuga moments noted, as focus was on dialogue, flashbacks, and emotional beats rather than action spectacle.

### Manga Differences
- Anime placed some flashback scenes indoors instead of outdoors
- Extended battle scenes for pacing
- **CONTROVERSIAL:** Anime-only flashback showing Arlong saving Hody from humans (contradicts manga's "nothing" reveal)

### Fan Reception
- Initial reception was mixed - some fans felt cheated by lack of tragic backstory
- Later re-evaluation (2016-2020s) appreciated Hody as relevant social commentary
- Episode considered one of the arc's high points despite overall arc pacing issues

## Questions & Blockers

### Minor Issues:
1. **Exact timestamps** - Could not verify precise timestamps for all events. Used estimated times based on episode structure and typical pacing.

2. **Complete voice actor list** - Could not find English voice actors for all minor characters (Ikaros Much, Dosun, Hyouzou, etc.). Left these as null.

3. **YouTube content** - Limited specific video analysis found for this individual episode. Most One Piece YouTubers cover arcs as wholes or specific chapters rather than individual anime episodes.

4. **Script availability** - No complete line-by-line transcript found. Used detailed plot summaries instead.

### Resolved Issues:
- ✅ Confirmed opening song "We Go!" by Hiroshi Kitadani (episodes 517-590)
- ✅ Confirmed no ending song (Toei stopped endings from ep 279-1070)
- ✅ Identified manga chapters covered (642, 644)
- ✅ Found staff credits (director, animation director, etc.)

## Special Notes

### Episode's Legacy
Episode 564 has gained appreciation over time as its themes of environmental racism and inherited hatred became more relevant to global conversations about radicalization. What some initially saw as a "weak" villain backstory is now recognized as sophisticated social commentary.

### Recommended Viewing Context
This episode works best when viewed as part of the larger Fish-Man Island Arc (especially episodes 541-546 covering Fisher Tiger and Otohime's backstories, and episode 563 which sets up Hody's revelation). The "reset to zero" moment pays off storylines established 20+ episodes earlier.

### Animation Note
Fish-Man Island Arc was later remastered as "One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga" (2024) with improved animation and condensed pacing. Researchers may want to compare both versions.
