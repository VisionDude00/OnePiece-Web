    "summary": "The theory that Hody Jones was intentionally created by Oda as a direct parallel to real-world radicalized individuals who adopt extremist views through environmental indoctrination rather than personal grievance, serving as social commentary on modern terrorism and inherited prejudice.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Eiichiro Oda created Hody Jones specifically as commentary on real-world radicalization and the alt-right. Unlike most One Piece villains who have tragic backstories explaining their actions, Hody's 'Nothing' revelation - that humans did nothing to him personally - mirrors how real extremists often adopt hateful ideologies from their environment rather than personal experience. The theory suggests Oda was making a statement about how prejudice is learned and perpetuated through generations, and how dangerous environmental racism can be. This interpretation gained traction in the late 2010s as anxiety increased due to political polarization and lone-wolf terrorism, with fans re-evaluating Hody as a more relevant and prescient villain than initially recognized.",

    "title": "The Fish-Man District as a Cycle of Hatred",
    "summary": "A theory examining how the Fish-Man District represents a self-perpetuating cycle where victims of discrimination become perpetrators, with each generation passing down hatred until it becomes divorced from its original cause, as exemplified by Hody having no personal reason to hate humans.",
    "fullText": "This theory posits that the Fish-Man District's evolution represents how cycles of hatred perpetuate and intensify over generations. While the original fish-men like Fisher Tiger had legitimate grievances from direct oppression, subsequent generations like Arlong inherited this hatred with less direct experience, and by Hody's generation, the hatred had become completely divorced from personal experience - it was simply 'tradition.' The theory suggests that Fukaboshi's 'reset to zero' plea represents the only way to break such cycles - not through revenge or justice for past wrongs, but by consciously choosing to end the pattern. Fans point to this as one of One Piece's most mature themes, showing that hatred itself, not the original oppressors, becomes the true enemy.",

    "summary": "The theory that Queen Otohime's dream of coexistence could only be achieved by completely resetting Fish-Man Island's relationship with the surface world, erasing centuries of grudges on both sides, which is why Fukaboshi specifically asks Luffy to 'reset to zero' rather than simply defeat Hody.",
    "fullText": "This theory examines why Fukaboshi specifically asks Luffy to 'reset their history to zero' rather than just defeat the New Fish-Man Pirates. Fans theorize that Otohime understood that true coexistence required more than just stopping the current conflict - it required erasing the accumulated weight of historical grudges. By asking Luffy, an outsider with no connection to the old conflicts, to defeat Hody, Fukaboshi is symbolically severing Fish-Man Island from its past. Luffy represents a 'zero point' - someone who judges people by their current actions rather than historical grievances. The theory suggests this is why Luffy declaring them 'friends' is so significant - he's offering a relationship based on the present, not the past. This parallels real-world peace processes where new generations must consciously choose to move beyond historical conflicts.",

    "summary": "A controversial theory discussing the anime-only addition of a flashback showing Arlong saving young Hody from human slave traders, which directly contradicts the manga's revelation that Hody had 'nothing' done to him by humans, fundamentally undermining his character's thematic purpose.",
    "fullText": "This theory criticizes an anime-only addition to Hody's backstory where Arlong is shown saving young Hody and his friends from humans attempting to kidnap them as slaves. Fans argue this addition completely contradicts the canonical reveal that humans did 'nothing' to Hody personally - his hatred was purely environmental. The theory suggests this was a misguided attempt by the anime staff to give Hody a more traditional tragic backstory, but it undermines the entire point of his character as someone radicalized purely through absorbed prejudice rather than personal trauma. Manga readers particularly criticized this change, noting it makes Hody less unique and impactful as a villain. Some theorize this scene was later edited or removed from remastered versions specifically because of this contradiction, though this has not been officially confirmed.",
