      "description": "The episode reveals the full meaning of Luffy's coded message: the '3D' crossed out with an 'X' and replaced with '2Y' means that instead of meeting in 3 days as originally planned at Sabaody Archipelago, the crew should meet in 2 years. This gives everyone time to train and become stronger.",
      "significance": "This is a pivotal moment in the series, establishing the two-year time skip that allows all the Straw Hat Pirates to train and develop new abilities. It shows Luffy's growth as a captain, recognizing that his crew needs to become stronger before continuing their journey in the New World.",
