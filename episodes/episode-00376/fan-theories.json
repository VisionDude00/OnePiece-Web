    "theory": "Despite being ordered by the World Government to eliminate all witnesses to Moria's defeat, Kuma seems to have a hidden agenda. Earlier episodes showed Kuma mentioning that Dragon raised a fine son, hinting at a connection to Luffy's father. Fans theorize that Kuma is secretly working with or sympathetic to the Revolutionary Army, and his actions throughout Thriller Bark (offering the ultimatum rather than immediately killing everyone, and his later actions in Episode 377) suggest he's not truly loyal to the World Government despite being a Warlord.",

    "theory": "After seeing Kuma repel attacks, air, and create the devastating Ursus Shock, fans began theorizing about the true limits of the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi. Some theorized that if Kuma can repel tangible and intangible things like air and attacks, he might be able to repel even more abstract concepts like pain, fatigue, or memories. This theory gained traction when fans noticed the incredible versatility of the fruit and wondered what else could be 'repelled.'",

    "theory": "Kuma's mission to eliminate all witnesses to Moria's defeat reveals that the World Government is deeply concerned about the perception of the Seven Warlords system. Fans theorized that the Warlords are more important for propaganda and political balance than actual strength, and that the system is fragile. Multiple Warlord defeats (Crocodile in Alabasta, now Moria) could cause pirates to lose fear of the system and the Marines to lose a crucial tool for maintaining the balance of power. This theory suggested the World Government would go to extreme lengths to preserve the Warlord system's reputation.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorized that Ursus Shock, given its catastrophic island-destroying power, might be considered a forbidden technique or one that Kuma only uses as a last resort. The theory suggested that using such a devastating attack might have significant drawbacks, physical toll, or energy cost that wasn't immediately apparent in the episode. The fact that Kuma creates such a massive attack just to eliminate relatively weak targets seemed excessive unless he wanted to ensure no one survived or if the technique had limitations on frequency of use.",
