## Challenges and Questions

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Script Availability:** Could not find a full episode script. Scripts are copyrighted and not publicly available. Relied on episode summaries, wikis, and detailed recaps instead.

2. **Exact Timestamps:** Had to estimate timestamps based on typical episode structure and event descriptions. Timestamps are approximate (±30 seconds).

3. **Podcast Content:** Search for One Piece podcasts specifically discussing Episode 376 did not yield results. Found written reviews and analyses instead.

4. **YouTube Site Search:** Direct YouTube site searches didn't work as expected. Found reaction videos through broader searches and alternate platforms (Bilibili, Patreon).

### Questions/Uncertainties:
1. **Animation Quality Classification:** Classified as "ABOVE_STANDARD" based on review stating "above standard level for One Piece." May need verification from multiple sources.

2. **Voice Actor Credits:** Compiled complete voice cast for Straw Hats based on general series information, but specific credits for this episode weren't explicitly confirmed beyond Kuma's voice actors.

3. **Manga Differences:** Only found general information about anime extending fight scenes and adding destruction shots. More detailed manga comparison would require direct chapter access.

## Final Notes

This episode serves as a crucial turning point in the Thriller Bark arc, introducing one of the most versatile and powerful Devil Fruits seen up to this point in the series. The research revealed that Episode 376 is primarily a setup episode for the legendary Episode 377, where Zoro makes his famous sacrifice.

The episode's high rating (9.1 on IMDb) and positive contemporary reviews indicate it was well-received by fans both in 2008 and by modern viewers. The Ursus Shock attack is frequently cited in discussions about the most powerful attacks in One Piece, and the episode's themes of loyalty and sacrifice resonate strongly with the series' core values.

The lack of available episode scripts was the primary limitation in this research, requiring reliance on detailed summaries and wiki information. However, the abundance of fan content, reviews, and analyses provided sufficient material to create comprehensive documentation of this episode's contributions to the One Piece story.
