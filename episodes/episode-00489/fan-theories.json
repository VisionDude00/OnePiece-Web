    "theoryText": "One theory suggests that Shanks might have arrived at the Marineford War not just to save Luffy or end the conflict, but to protect the world from Imu. The theory posits that Shanks likely knows of Imu's existence since he's a renowned Celestial Dragon, and perhaps he came to Marineford to protect Luffy in case he awakened the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika. According to this theory, Shanks wasn't there just to save the war but to protect Luffy from potentially awakening his Devil Fruit and attracting Imu's attention at such a vulnerable moment.",

    "theoryText": "One of the biggest mysteries surrounding Episode 489 is how Shanks managed to arrive at Marineford just one day after reportedly fighting with Kaido. Various theories have been proposed: (1) Shanks has access to special travel methods unknown to others, (2) The report of fighting Kaido was exaggerated or misunderstood, (3) Shanks has a special ability or connection that allows for rapid travel, or (4) The timeline is not as tight as it appears. This mystery continues to fuel fan speculation about Shanks' true capabilities and resources.",
