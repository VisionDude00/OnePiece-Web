    "title": "Blackbeard Has Multiple Souls or Personalities",
    "theory": "When Luffy and Zoro say 'It's not him, it's them' after encountering Blackbeard, they may be sensing that Blackbeard has multiple souls, personalities, or even multiple people inhabiting one body. This could explain his unique ability to possess two Devil Fruits later in the series, as each soul/personality could hold one fruit. Evidence includes Blackbeard's contradictory behavior (hating then loving the same drink in consecutive episodes) and his unique physiology mentioned later in the series.",

    "theory": "A simpler explanation for the 'It's not him, it's them' comment is that Blackbeard was not alone on Jaya. Luffy and Zoro may have sensed his crew members nearby, or were referring to the fact that he had companions with him. This is a more straightforward interpretation that doesn't require supernatural explanations.",

    "theory": "Building on the multiple souls theory, some fans believe Blackbeard specifically has three souls or personalities, which explains why he could acquire three Devil Fruit powers (though only two have been shown so far). The Blackbeard Pirates' ship has three skulls on its flag, and Blackbeard himself has been associated with the number three throughout the series. This would explain the plural 'them' used by Luffy and Zoro.",

This shows how Shanks' example influenced Luffy's understanding that some fights aren't worth having, and that true strength sometimes means not fighting. The parallel demonstrates Luffy's growth and his adoption of Shanks' values.",

This isn't just a continuity error - it's evidence of multiple personalities or souls within Blackbeard. Each personality has different preferences, which manifests as contradictory behavior. This foreshadows the revelation of his unusual body structure.",
