### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Episode-Specific External Media**: Most reaction content and analysis focuses on the arc as a whole rather than individual episodes. Found some Patreon-exclusive reactions but limited free YouTube content.

2. **Fan Theories**: Difficult to find specific fan theories about Episode 115 itself. Most theories discuss the arc broadly or focus on later revelations. Created theories based on how moments in this episode connect to later series events.

3. **Timestamp Approximations**: Without direct access to the episode video, timestamps are approximated based on typical episode structure and manga chapter progression. Actual timestamps may vary by ±30 seconds.

4. **Voice Actor Confirmation**: While major character voice actors are well-documented, some supporting character voice credits may be incomplete.
