This moment foreshadows his future confrontation with Luffy over the Merry, his stand at Enies Lobby, and his evolution into a true brave warrior of the sea.",

This weakness is exploited again in future arcs and represents Sanji's unwavering chivalry even at the cost of his own safety, tying into his character's core values instilled by Zeff.",
