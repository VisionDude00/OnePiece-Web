## Plot Summary
Caesar Clown, enraged by the escaped intruders within his laboratory, orchestrates a deadly trap by sealing the passage between Buildings A and B and releasing the poisonous gas Shinokuni into Building A. As the deadly gas floods the building, the Straw Hats and G-5 Marines engage in a desperate race to reach the closing gate. Chopper sneaks away to find the captive children, while Luffy defeats the guard Run with ease. When the exterior wall is destroyed and Shinokuni begins petrifying everyone in its path, several brave G-5 Marines make the ultimate sacrifice, staying behind to ensure Captain Tashigi escapes through the gate. As they are petrified by the poison gas, the Marines give thumbs up and peace signs to encourage their surviving comrades. Safe on the other side, Tashigi breaks down in tears, witnessing the loss of her subordinates who gave their lives to save hers.
