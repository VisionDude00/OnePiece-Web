    "title": "G-8 Should Be Canon",
    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize or wish that the G-8 arc should be considered canon to the One Piece story. The arc is so well-written, with excellent characterization of both the Straw Hats and the Marines (particularly Vice Admiral Jonathan), that it seamlessly fits into the narrative between Skypiea and Water 7. Fans argue that the arc shares the essence of One Piece as if it were written by Eiichiro Oda himself, retaining the characteristic interactions between the Straw Hats while presenting a different perspective on the Marines. Some believe that if Oda had written it into the manga, it would be considered one of the better arcs in the series.",

    "theoryText": "In 2019, series director Kōnosuke Uda revealed that the G-8 arc was originally conceived as a theatrical film plot. This explains why the arc feels more cohesive and polished than typical filler content. The theory is that the production team decided to adapt it as an 11-episode arc instead of a movie, which is why it maintains high quality throughout and has a clear three-act structure with setup, escalation, and resolution. This also explains why Commander Jonathan is such a well-developed antagonist despite being a filler character.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Vice Admiral Jonathan never truly intended to capture the Straw Hat Pirates and was using their appearance as a training exercise and morale booster for his troops. This theory is supported by Jonathan's revelation at the end of the arc that he saw the Straw Hats' infiltration as a means of bringing his soldiers together and proving to Marine Headquarters that G-8 was still important and didn't deserve to be decommissioned. Fans debate whether Jonathan planned this from the beginning or adapted his goals as the arc progressed.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 202 and the surrounding G-8 arc episodes gave birth to one of One Piece's most famous memes: 'Condoriano.' This refers to when Usopp disguised himself and pretended to be a Marine named 'Condoriano' (a combination of 'Con-' from con artist and '-doriano'). The meme became so popular that fans jokingly treat Condoriano as if he were a real character, creating elaborate theories about his 'importance' to the story and claiming he's the strongest character in One Piece. While not a serious theory, it represents the cultural impact of the G-8 arc's comedy.",
