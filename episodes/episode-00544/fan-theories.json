    "summary": "A theory that Jinbe carries immense guilt over his decision to have Arlong released from Impel Down, as it directly enabled Arlong's reign of terror in the East Blue and Nami's suffering.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that Jinbe's decision to use his Shichibukai pardon to release Arlong from Impel Down is one of his greatest regrets. While Jinbe intended to reunite the Sun Pirates and honor their brotherhood, he couldn't foresee that Arlong would immediately leave and terrorize the East Blue. This decision directly led to the enslavement of Nami and the suffering of Cocoyasi Village. Many fans believe this guilt is why Jinbe is so protective of Luffy and the Straw Hats - he feels responsible for the pain Arlong caused Nami and wants to make amends. His inability to kill Arlong despite beating him brutally shows the tragic conflict between his morality and the practical need to stop a dangerous individual.",

    "summary": "A widely-discussed theory that Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime represent different civil rights philosophies, paralleling Martin Luther King Jr.'s peaceful integration and Malcolm X's self-determination.",
    "fullText": "Fans and critics have noted that Eiichiro Oda deliberately created Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime as allegorical figures representing different approaches to fighting oppression, directly paralleling the civil rights movement. Queen Otohime advocates for peaceful coexistence, integration with humans on the surface, and changing hearts through education and compassion - similar to MLK's philosophy. Fisher Tiger, while not advocating violence against innocents, believes in separation, self-sufficiency, and freedom through direct action (freeing slaves from Mary Geoise) - echoing Malcolm X's approach. The tragedy of the Fish-Man Island arc is that both leaders are assassinated before their visions can be fully realized, and their deaths create a power vacuum filled by extremists like Arlong and Hody Jones. Jinbe represents the next generation trying to honor both philosophies while charting his own path.",

    "summary": "A theory about the deeper meaning of the Sun Pirates' sun brand covering the Celestial Dragons' slave mark, representing not just practical concealment but ideological freedom.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that Fisher Tiger's decision to brand all Sun Pirates members with the sun symbol - covering the Celestial Dragons' 'Hoof of the Soaring Dragon' slave mark - was not just a practical strategy to hide former slaves' identities, but a profound philosophical statement about equality and freedom. By making everyone in the crew bear the same mark, Tiger created true equality: former slaves couldn't be distinguished from free fish-men. The sun symbol itself represents illumination, hope, and a new dawn - the opposite of the darkness of slavery. Some fans suggest this act inspired other revolutionary figures in One Piece, and that the symbolism of covering oppressors' marks with symbols of hope is a recurring theme. The tragedy is that after Tiger's death, this symbol of unity couldn't prevent the crew's ideological split, showing that symbols alone can't overcome deep-seated trauma and hatred.",

    "summary": "A theory that Arlong's lie about Fisher Tiger's death - claiming humans refused him a blood transfusion - became propaganda that fueled generations of anti-human sentiment and enabled Hody Jones's rise.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that Arlong's decision to lie to the Marines about Fisher Tiger's death had far-reaching consequences beyond protecting Tiger's honor. By claiming that humans refused to give Tiger a blood transfusion (rather than admitting Tiger refused human blood), Arlong created a powerful propaganda narrative that spread throughout Fish-Man Island. This lie painted humans as irredeemably cruel and reinforced the belief that coexistence was impossible. Jinbe notes that Arlong's version omitted key details, but the lie had already spread. Years later, this false narrative helped extremists like Hody Jones recruit followers and justify their hatred. Some fans believe that if the truth - that Tiger's hatred ran so deep he chose death over human blood - had been revealed, it might have been a cautionary tale about how hatred destroys rather than propaganda for revenge. The episode shows Arlong deliberately crafting this narrative, making him not just a violent extremist but a manipulative propagandist.",

    "summary": "A theory connecting Jinbe's inability to kill Arlong in episode 544 directly to the suffering depicted in the Arlong Park arc, creating a tragic chain of cause and effect.",
    "fullText": "This theory posits that episode 544 contains one of the most consequential decisions in One Piece: Jinbe's choice to spare Arlong's life after beating him. Fans note that Jinbe clearly understood the danger Arlong posed - he was willing to fight him to the point of near-death - but his loyalty to their shared history under Fisher Tiger prevented the killing blow. This mercy directly enabled everything that happened in the Arlong Park arc: Arlong's journey to the East Blue, his conquest of Cocoyasi Village, Nami's enslavement, Bellemere's death, and years of suffering for the villagers. Some fans argue this makes Jinbe partially responsible for these tragedies, while others view it as a tragic demonstration that doing the 'right' thing (honoring brotherhood, refusing to kill) can have terrible consequences. This theory suggests Jinbe carried this guilt throughout his journey and it influenced his later decision to help the Straw Hats, seeing it as a form of atonement for failing to stop Arlong when he had the chance.",
