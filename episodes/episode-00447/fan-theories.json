    "theoryText": "Fans theorized that Blackbeard's infiltration of Impel Down was not just coincidental but part of a larger strategic plan. Questions raised include whether there's a secret stash of Devil Fruits somewhere in the prison, or if there's a clue to Raftel's location hidden in a vault. The theory suggests Blackbeard risked his Warlord position for something far more valuable than just causing chaos.",

The theory examines how Luffy 'just happens to cross Blackbeard's path' throughout the series and analyzes why Blackbeard will be Luffy's greatest opponent, drawing parallels to their contrasting philosophies about dreams and the nature of piracy.",

    "title": "Impel Down Arc Shows Luffy's Moral Ambiguity",
    "theoryText": "Some fans argue that the Impel Down arc, particularly episodes around 447, proves Luffy was never the classic shonen hero we thought he was. The theory points out that Luffy freed some of the world's worst criminals and indirectly helped Blackbeard complete his crew by causing chaos in the prison. This demonstrates Luffy's willingness to work with villains and create collateral damage when pursuing his personal goals.",
