    "theory": "Sanji's absolute refusal to fight women, while noble, is portrayed as a genuine character flaw rather than purely virtuous behavior. The Kalifa incident demonstrates that his code can actively endanger his crew and mission, suggesting that rigid adherence to any principle, even a good one, can be problematic when it conflicts with protecting those you care about.",

    "theory": "The Enies Lobby arc deliberately showcases how each Straw Hat has specific limitations that require other crew members to compensate. Sanji cannot fight women, so Nami takes over against Kalifa. This reinforces the theme that the crew needs all its members and their diverse strengths to overcome challenges no single member could handle alone.",
