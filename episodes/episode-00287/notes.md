## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
- One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Primary source for episode details
- IMDb - Episode ratings and basic information
- Various forums and community discussions
- YouTube reaction videos
- Tumblr blog posts analyzing the episode

### Key Findings

1. **Episode Focus**: This episode is primarily centered on Sanji's moral dilemma and his absolute adherence to his code of chivalry, even when it costs him the battle against Kalifa.

2. **No Script Found**: Despite searching multiple transcript archives, a complete episode script was not available. Research relied on:
   - Episode summaries from wikis
   - Fan discussions and analyses
   - Video content descriptions
   - Manga chapters 402-403 as source material

3. **Character Moments**: The episode features significant character development moments for:
   - **Sanji**: His defeat and explanation of his chivalrous code
   - **Nami**: Her decision to take over the fight against Kalifa
   - **Kaku**: Displaying devastating power by bisecting the Tower of Justice
   - **Zoro & Sogeking**: Forced to fight while handcuffed together

4. **Technical Abilities Debuted**:
   - Rankyaku: Amane Dachi (Kaku)
   - Seimei Kikan techniques (Kumadori)
   - Franky Boxing (Franky)
   - Golden Hour/Awa Awa powers used on Sanji (Kalifa)

### Notable Observations

1. **Controversial Episode**: This episode is frequently cited in fan discussions as one of the most controversial moments in Sanji's character arc. Many fans changed their opinions of Sanji after this episode.

2. **No Ending Song**: Episode 287 aired during the period (episodes 279-1070) when One Piece stopped using ending themes, instead extending the opening.

3. **High Production Quality**: The episode features several impressive visual moments, particularly Kaku's tower bisection.

4. **TV Ratings**: Achieved 8.1% TV rating, ranking 6th in its timeslot.

### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Script Access**: Could not locate a complete episode transcript. Had to rely on summaries and scene descriptions from wikis and forums.

2. **Timestamp Estimates**: Without access to the actual episode video, timestamps for events are approximate based on typical One Piece episode pacing and wiki descriptions.

3. **Voice Actor Credits**: Japanese voice actors were confirmed through wikis, but some English voice actors were inferred based on standard casting for the Enies Lobby arc.

4. **External Media Metrics**: Many reaction videos and articles lack specific engagement metrics (views, likes, etc.), especially those behind paywalls on Patreon.

### Thematic Analysis

The episode explores several key themes:

1. **Rigid Principles vs. Pragmatism**: Sanji's unwavering code becomes a liability
2. **Crew Complementarity**: Nami covers for Sanji's weakness
3. **Character Trauma**: Sanji's code appears to be deeply ingrained from childhood conditioning
4. **Loyalty and Sacrifice**: Characters willing to take on impossible challenges for their crewmates

## Summary
