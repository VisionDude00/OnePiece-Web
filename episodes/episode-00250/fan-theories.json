Just as Tom taught that the ships themselves are neutral and it's the users who determine morality, this same principle applies to the Ancient Weapons - they are tools that can be used for good or evil depending on who wields them.",

Just as Tom's creation inadvertently harmed Franky, Franky's own Battle Franky ships were used to harm Tom. This teaches Franky that he must build the Sunny with the understanding that it could be destroyed or misused, but he must still take pride in it.",

Tom may not have the D. in his name, but his refusal to show regret and his commitment to his dreams despite the consequences align him spiritually with the D. clan's ideals of pursuing freedom and dreams without hesitation.",
