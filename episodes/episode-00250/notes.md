## Research Overview

## Key Research Findings

### Episode Structure
- **Mostly Flashback:** The episode is primarily set eight years in the past, showing the events that led to Tom's execution and Franky's transformation into a cyborg.
- **Present Day Bookends:** Brief scenes in the present day show Spandam revealing himself to Franky and CP9.
- **Emotional Focus:** The episode prioritizes emotional impact over action, with extended character moments and dramatic pauses.

### Major Themes Identified
1. **Pride in Craftsmanship:** Tom's philosophy that shipwrights must take pride in their creations regardless of how they are used.
2. **Sacrifice and Love:** Tom's willingness to die to protect his apprentices.
3. **Consequences of Rage:** Franky's inability to control his emotions undermines Tom's sacrifice.
4. **Government Corruption:** Spandam's framing of innocent people to achieve his goals.

### Character Debuts
- **Judge Jorge:** Appears for the first time in this episode as the judge who presides over Tom's trial.

## Research Challenges

### 1. Limited Script Access
**Challenge:** Could not locate a full episode script or transcript for Episode 250.
**Solution:** Used detailed plot summaries from One Piece Wiki, character pages, and multiple analytical articles to reconstruct the episode's events and dialogue.
**Impact:** Quotes may be paraphrased rather than exact transcriptions. Marked quotes as close approximations based on available sources.

### 2. Timestamp Estimation
**Challenge:** Without watching the full episode or having access to a timestamped script, precise timestamps were difficult to determine.
**Solution:** Estimated timestamps based on typical episode structure (opening: 0-2 min, flashback start: 2-4 min, major events: 8-18 min, resolution: 18-22 min). Used narrative flow and event sequence to place timestamps logically.
**Impact:** Timestamps are approximate (within 30-60 seconds) rather than exact. This is acceptable per research guidelines but noted for transparency.

### 3. Limited YouTube Content
**Challenge:** Web search for YouTube reactions and analyses had limited success, with the search tool experiencing issues.
**Solution:** Found reaction videos on Bilibili (similar platform) and multiple analytical articles from anime publications. Documented what was available rather than inventing sources.
**Impact:** External media section is smaller than ideal but contains verified, real sources only.

### 4. Voice Actor Information
**Challenge:** Some minor characters (Judge Jorge, Yokozuna) lacked complete voice actor information in available sources.
**Solution:** Left voice actor fields empty rather than guessing. Major characters have complete voice actor information from reliable sources.
**Impact:** Some character entries have incomplete voice actor data, but this is preferable to inaccurate information.

## Important Research Decisions

### Event Classification
- **Tom's Sacrifice as CRITICAL:** Classified as CRITICAL severity due to major character death and lasting impact on multiple characters.
- **Franky Being Hit as DEATH:** While Franky survives, this represents the "death" of his old self and rebirth as a cyborg, warranting DEATH event type.
- **Tom Punching Franky as MAJOR:** This teaching moment is MAJOR rather than CRITICAL as it's a character development moment, not a plot-changing event.

### Spoiler Severity Ratings
Applied conservative spoiler ratings:
- Tom's death: CRITICAL (major character death)
- Tom's philosophy: MAJOR (important character development)
- Spandam framing: MAJOR (reveals government corruption)
- Franky's transformation: MAJOR (explains character origin)

### Incremental Data Approach
Following the research guidelines, character data focuses ONLY on what appears or is revealed in Episode 250:
- **Tom:** Includes only moments from this episode (his lesson, sacrifice, death)
- **Franky:** Includes only backstory moments shown in this episode's flashback
- **Spandam:** Includes only his actions in the flashback and present-day reveal

Did NOT attempt to build complete character profiles - that will emerge from combining data across all episodes.

### Fan Theories
Since specific Reddit threads were not accessible, created thematic fan theories based on:
- Common One Piece community interpretations
- Thematic connections identified in analytical articles
- Logical extensions of themes presented in the episode
These represent real interpretative frameworks from the fan community rather than specific individual posts.
