    "theoryText": "The Davy Back Fight introduced in this arc will be used for the climactic confrontation between Luffy and Shanks. Rather than a traditional battle, they will compete in a Davy Back Fight to determine who is worthy of the One Piece, with the straw hat itself as the ultimate prize. This would fit One Piece's themes of friendly competition and allow them to test each other without killing intent.",
