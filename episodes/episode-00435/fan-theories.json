    "summary": "A theory that Magellan has already awakened the Doku Doku no Mi, explaining his extraordinary control over poison and ability to affect the environment.",
    "fullText": "Fans theorize that Magellan may have already awakened his Doku Doku no Mi Devil Fruit. Evidence includes his ability to spread poison like a disease over everything it touches (affecting non-organic materials like stone and metal), his mastery of various poison types, and his environmental manipulation techniques like Venom Road. Considering what we know about Paramecia Awakenings giving greater control over the environment, Magellan's abilities seem to fit this pattern. His poison doesn't just exist as a substance he creates - it actively spreads and corrupts the environment around him, which could be a sign of awakening.",

    "fullText": "The Doku Doku no Mi is clearly one of the most powerful Devil Fruits in the series, with potential to be devastating in combat. Fans have debated why Blackbeard, who specifically hunts powerful Devil Fruits, didn't attempt to kill Magellan and take his fruit during the Impel Down arc. Theories include: 1) Blackbeard needed a specific type of fruit (like Logia types) that matched his body's ability to hold multiple fruits, 2) He was in a hurry to reach Whitebeard and didn't want to risk a prolonged battle with Magellan, 3) The poison fruit's side effect (chronic diarrhea) made it undesirable despite its power, 4) Blackbeard's crew didn't have the antidote or means to safely defeat Magellan. Some fans suggest that the extreme danger of fighting Magellan (one touch means death by poison) made the risk not worth the reward when Blackbeard already had targets in mind.",

    "summary": "Ongoing fan debate about whether Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi is actually a Logia-type fruit disguised as Paramecia.",
    "fullText": "Despite Oda confirming the Doku Doku no Mi is Paramecia-type, fans continue to debate its classification. Pro-Logia arguments: Magellan is stated as BEING poison, not just creating it; his body appears to be made entirely of poison; he can reform his body from poison attacks. Pro-Paramecia arguments: He traveled USING poison (Venom Road) rather than AS poison; he generates poison but doesn't transform into it; Oda explicitly stated 'It is no more than a somewhat different Paramecia because its user can generate all kinds of poisons but not transform into it.' The confusion largely stems from the anime's portrayal making him appear more Logia-like than the manga. Some fans theorize that if awakened, it could gain Logia-like properties, blurring the line between fruit types.",
