    "theoryText": "Based on the reveal that Garp flattened Chinjao's drill-shaped head 30 years ago, fans theorized that Luffy would eventually restore it during their battle. Since Garp broke it with a punch, a powerful enough punch from his grandson could potentially restore it to its original shape. This would turn Chinjao from an enemy into an ally, as Luffy would be undoing the damage his grandfather caused.",
