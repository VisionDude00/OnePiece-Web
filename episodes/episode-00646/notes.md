# Episode 646 Research Notes

## Episode Title
"The Legendary Pirate! Don Chinjao!"

## Research Date
2026-01-29

## Key Observations

### Episode Structure
- Episode 646 continues the Block C battle royale at the Corrida Colosseum
- Features dual storylines: the tournament in Dressrosa and the Straw Hats defending the Thousand Sunny
- Ends on a spectacular cliffhanger with Luffy and Chinjao's Haki clash

### Important Debuts
- **Hasshoken martial arts** - First introduction of this vibration-based combat technique
- **Jake Jake no Mi powers** - Kelly Funk's unusual Devil Fruit ability is revealed
- No character debuts (all featured characters appeared in episode 645 first)

### Narrative Significance
1. **Chinjao's Backstory**: The reveal of Garp flattening Chinjao's head 30 years ago adds significant depth to both characters and explains Chinjao's motivation
2. **Generational Conflict**: The grudge extending from Garp to Luffy exemplifies the theme of inherited conflicts
3. **Power Escalation**: The Haki clash demonstrates the high level of combat in the New World

### Manga Adaptation
- Episode adapts Chapter 716 (pages 2-19)
- Several minor differences noted between anime and manga versions
- Most significant: Luffy asking about both Jinbe and Ivankov (manga only mentions Ivankov)

### Production Notes
- Originally aired as part of a one-hour special with Toriko
- Skipped by Funimation's simulcast, later released by Crunchyroll
- Animation directors: Yūsuke Isōchi and Aya Komaki
- No ending theme (consistent with episodes 279-1070)

### Character Analysis

**Don Chinjao**:
- Complex character with legitimate grievance against Garp
- Bounty over 500 million berries indicates legendary status
- Master of Hasshoken and possesses Conqueror's Haki
- His flattened head serves as constant reminder of defeat

**Kelly Funk**:
- Jake Jake no Mi is one of the more creative/unusual Devil Fruits
- Requires teamwork with Bobby, making it unique among Paramecia fruits
- Despite Devil Fruit advantage, defeated by skilled martial artist (Sai)

**Sai**:
- Demonstrates strong leadership qualities
- Hasshoken techniques showcase Kano Country's martial arts tradition
- Values loyalty to crew members above winning tournament

### Thematic Elements
1. **Legacy**: How past conflicts shape present relationships
2. **Loyalty**: Sai's protection of Boo, the Straw Hats defending each other
3. **Power Systems**: Introduction of Hasshoken alongside Devil Fruits and Haki
4. **Family Bonds**: The Funk Brothers, the Chinjao Family, Garp-Luffy connection

### Fan Reception
- Episode rated 9.0/10 on IMDb
- The Haki clash scene became highly popular on social media
- Fans correctly predicted Luffy would restore Chinjao's head (confirmed in episode 649)

### Research Challenges
- Limited availability of full episode scripts
- Some voice actor information not readily available for minor characters
- Exact timestamps estimated based on typical episode structure

### Connections to Broader Story
- Impel Down arc callbacks through Jean Ango
- Marineford arc connections (Mera Mera no Mi, mentions of Jinbe/Ivankov)
- Foreshadowing of Straw Hat Grand Fleet formation
- Garp's legendary past further established
