    "theory": "Despite Sogeking claiming to be from Sniper Island and being a separate person, many fans theorize that Sogeking is actually Usopp in disguise. Evidence includes: identical voice, same fighting style and weapons, appearing right after Usopp refused to help, and the fact that Sogeking's mask looks similar to Usopp's goggles.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that 'Sniper Island' that Sogeking claims to be from doesn't exist as a physical location, but rather represents Usopp's courage and determination - it exists in his heart. This theory suggests that Usopp created the Sogeking persona as a manifestation of the brave warrior he wants to become.",

    "theory": "While most of the crew (and viewers) immediately recognize that Sogeking is Usopp, Luffy and Chopper genuinely cannot tell. Some fans theorize this isn't just for comedic effect - it reflects Luffy and Chopper's pure, innocent nature. They take things at face value and don't overthink, so if someone says they're a different person, they believe it. This also shows their respect for Usopp's need to maintain his pride.",

He doesn't round down or settle for less; he rounds up, symbolizing his tendency to exceed expectations and push beyond normal limits.",
