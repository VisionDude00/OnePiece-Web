    "title": "Lucci's Justification Theory: Dark Justice as Utilitarian Extremism",
    "summary": "A theory that Lucci's 'Dark Justice' is a twisted form of utilitarian philosophy taken to its extreme, where he believes killing the weak prevents greater harm to society and the World Government's mission.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Lucci's justification for killing the 500 hostages wasn't purely psychopathic, but rather a calculated application of extreme utilitarian logic. By his reasoning, soldiers who allowed themselves to be captured demonstrated weakness that could compromise future missions and endanger others. By eliminating them, he both resolved the immediate crisis and removed what he saw as liabilities to the kingdom's defense. This theory suggests Lucci genuinely believes his 'Dark Justice' serves a greater good, even if his methods are horrific. It parallels how the World Government itself operates - willing to sacrifice individuals and even entire populations (like Ohara) for what they perceive as the greater stability of the world. Lucci didn't join CP9 just for bloodlust, but because the organization aligns with his belief that the ends justify any means. This makes him more terrifying than a simple sadist - he's a true believer in a fundamentally evil ideology.",

    "title": "Parallel Justice Systems: Dark Justice vs Absolute Justice",
    "summary": "A theory that 'Dark Justice' (CP9) and 'Absolute Justice' (Marines like Akainu) are two sides of the same coin, both representing the World Government's willingness to sacrifice anyone for their goals.",
    "fullText": "Episode 305 reveals a striking parallel between CP9's 'Dark Justice' and the Marines' 'Absolute Justice' through the actions of Lucci and Vice-Admiral Onigumo. Both Lucci (killing 500 hostages) and Onigumo (ordering bombardment of his own ship) demonstrate the same core principle: individual lives are expendable in service of the mission. Fans theorize that the World Government deliberately cultivates these parallel ideologies - CP9 for covert operations where plausible deniability is needed, and hardline Marines like Akainu for public enforcement. Both serve the same master and share the same ruthless pragmatism. This theory suggests that the true enemy isn't individual villains but the system that creates and rewards such thinking. The episode positions Luffy's protective justice (fighting to save every friend) as the antithesis to both forms of World Government justice. Where Lucci and Onigumo see weakness and acceptable losses, Luffy sees people worth protecting at any cost.",

    "summary": "A dark theory that the 500 soldiers Lucci killed were already doomed, and his quick execution was 'merciful' compared to what the pirates would have done, further illustrating his twisted worldview.",
    "fullText": "Some fans propose that from Lucci's perspective, the 500 soldiers were already 'dead' the moment they were captured, having failed their duty and lost their right to live. In his twisted logic, giving them a quick death was actually more merciful than letting the pirates torture them or the World Government deal with 'failed soldiers' later. This theory suggests Lucci sees himself not as a murderer but as an 'executor' removing those who have already forfeited their lives through weakness. This makes his character even more chilling - he doesn't kill out of rage or sadism, but from a cold, calculated belief system where death is the natural consequence of failure. The theory points to how calmly young Lucci performed the execution, without hesitation or emotion, suggesting he genuinely believed he was doing the right thing. This contrasts with typical villains who know they're evil - Lucci thinks he's the only one seeing clearly.",
