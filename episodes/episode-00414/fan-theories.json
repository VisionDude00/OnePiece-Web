    "theory": "The moment when Luffy protects Sandersonia's slave mark parallels Fisher Tiger's freeing of the slaves from Mary Geoise. Both acts represent pure compassion toward those who suffered under the Celestial Dragons, without asking for anything in return. This thematic parallel suggests that Luffy represents the same spirit of liberation that Fisher Tiger embodied, which is why the Gorgon Sisters are so deeply moved - they recognize the same selfless heroism.",

    "theory": "Luffy's instinctive protection of the slave mark in Episode 414, combined with his later willingness to help Hancock despite not fully understanding her past, sets up his eventual assault on a Celestial Dragon at Sabaody. The episode demonstrates that Luffy has an innate hatred for the oppression symbolized by the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon, even before learning what it means. His character is fundamentally opposed to the Celestial Dragons' worldview, foreshadowing his future direct confrontation with them.",

    "theory": "Fans theorize that Hancock's love for Luffy isn't simply romantic attraction but a deep psychological healing response. Episode 414 shows the first crack in her trauma-induced wall - when Luffy protects Sandersonia, he demonstrates that not all men are like the Celestial Dragons who tortured them. This moment begins to heal her deep-seated trauma and fear of men. Her 'love' is actually her psyche's way of processing this healing, mixing gratitude, relief, and genuine affection into what appears as romantic love.",

    "theory": "Episode 414's fight deliberately shows that Observation Haki (Kenbunshoku Haki) has a critical limitation: physical speed. Fans theorize this was Oda's way of establishing early that Haki isn't an absolute power - it can be overcome with sufficient speed and skill. This sets up future power scaling where characters need to balance Haki mastery with physical capabilities. The episode demonstrates that seeing the future is meaningless if your body can't react, which becomes important in later high-level battles.",

Having grown up hearing about the oppression in the world from people like Sabo (who was fleeing from becoming a Celestial Dragon's slave) and later seeing slavery firsthand, Luffy instinctively recognized that whatever was on Sandersonia's back was something that marked her as a victim. His instant protective response wasn't random compassion - it was informed by his own understanding of oppression and his hatred for it.",
