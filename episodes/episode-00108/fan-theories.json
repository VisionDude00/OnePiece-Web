    "theoryText": "Sanji's choice to call himself 'Mr. Prince' in the Arabasta Arc is not random - it foreshadows his true identity as Vinsmoke Sanji, the third prince of the Germa Kingdom. Combined with other subtle hints throughout the series (his refined manners, knowledge of nobility, refusal to wear a crown during the Davy Back Fight), fans theorized for over a decade that Sanji had royal connections before it was confirmed in the Whole Cake Island Arc.",
