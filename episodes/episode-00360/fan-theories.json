    "theoryTitle": "Usopp as Perona's Perfect Counter",
    "theoryText": "Usopp is uniquely suited to fight Perona not just because he discovers her physical body's location, but because his inherently negative personality makes him immune to her Negative Hollow attack. Since Usopp already possesses such a low opinion of himself and is naturally pessimistic, Perona's depression-inducing ghosts have no effect on him. This makes Usopp her only natural enemy among the Straw Hats, as he cannot be emotionally incapacitated by her most powerful ability.",

    "theoryTitle": "Perona's Astral Projection Weakness Was Foreshadowed",
    "theoryText": "The discovery that Perona's real body is vulnerable while she projects her astral form follows the classic pattern of powerful abilities having hidden weaknesses. Her overconfidence in appearing invincible through intangibility directly leads to her downfall, as she doesn't adequately protect her physical body. This represents a common theme in One Piece where relying solely on Devil Fruit powers without proper strategy leads to defeat.",

    "theoryText": "The return of Sogeking at Thriller Bark represents more than just a disguise - it's Usopp's psychological mechanism for accessing courage he doesn't believe he naturally possesses. By 'becoming' Sogeking, Usopp can push past his fear and self-doubt to perform heroic actions. The episode shows this when facing certain defeat against Perona, Usopp 'calls upon' Sogeking to help him, essentially calling upon his own inner strength through this alter ego.",
