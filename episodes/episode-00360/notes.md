# Research Notes for Episode 360

## Episode Overview
Episode 360 "Save Me, Hero!! My Enemy Is the Immortal Princess" is a pivotal episode in the Thriller Bark arc, focusing primarily on Usopp's battle against Perona.

## Research Process

### Sources Used
- One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Primary source for episode details
- The Adult Swim Squad blog - Detailed episode recap
- IMDb - Air dates and ratings
- Behind The Voice Actors - Voice actor information
- Various wiki pages for abilities and characters

### Key Findings

1. **Episode Coverage**: This episode adapts manga Chapter 465 (pages 2-19), focusing primarily on the Usopp vs Perona battle.

2. **New Abilities Revealed**:
   - Usopp debuts three new Kabuto techniques: Ageha Ryusei, Kamakiri Ryusei, and Atlas Suisei
   - Perona reveals Mini Hollow and Ghost Rap techniques
   - Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Fingernet for the first time

3. **Character Development**: This episode showcases significant character development for Usopp:
   - Returns to his Sogeking persona to overcome fear
   - Demonstrates exceptional observational and deductive skills
   - Successfully identifies Perona's weakness through strategic thinking

4. **Production Details**:
   - Director: Munehisa Sakai
   - Writer: Hirohiko Kamisaka
   - Animation Director: Could not be confirmed from available sources
   - Opening: Jungle P by 5050 (episodes 326-372)
   - No ending song (discontinued from episode 279)

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Animation Director**: Could not find specific animation director credit for this individual episode. This information may be in the episode credits but is not commonly documented online for episodes from this era.

2. **Exact Timestamps**: While the episode was researched through summaries and recaps, exact timestamps for some events had to be estimated based on typical episode pacing and scene descriptions.

3. **Voice Actor Confirmation**: Initial search suggested Akemi Okamura for Perona, but this was incorrect. Confirmed Kumiko Nishihara as the correct Japanese voice actor through Behind The Voice Actors database.

4. **Script Access**: Could not locate a full transcript of the episode. Research was based on wiki summaries, recaps, and episode descriptions.

### Notable Observations

1. **Sogeking's Return**: This is the first time Sogeking appears since the Enies Lobby arc (episodes 258-262), making it a significant callback for fans.

2. **Strategic Combat**: Unlike most Straw Hat battles that rely on physical power, this episode emphasizes intelligence and observation as the path to victory.

3. **Devil Fruit Limitations**: The episode clearly establishes the weakness of Perona's powerful ability - her physical body is vulnerable while projecting her astral form.

4. **Foreshadowing**: Perona's behavioral change during the Kumashi fight subtly foreshadowed her weakness, which Usopp picked up on.

## Summary

Episode 360 represents a crucial turning point in the Thriller Bark arc, with Usopp discovering Perona's weakness through clever observation rather than brute force. The episode introduces several new abilities and marks the return of Sogeking, providing both action and character development. Research was comprehensive but limited by the lack of a full episode script and some production details that are not commonly documented online for episodes from this period.
