    "summary": "Fans theorize that Robin's apparent betrayal is actually a self-sacrifice, with her cooperating with CP9 to protect the crew from the World Government's Buster Call threat.",
    "fullText": "During the Water 7 arc, many viewers initially theorized that Robin was sacrificing herself to protect her crewmates rather than truly betraying them. The theory suggested that CP9 had threatened to use a Buster Call (an island-destroying fleet) against the Straw Hats if Robin didn't cooperate. Robin, carrying the trauma of being betrayed throughout her life and witnessing Ohara's destruction via Buster Call, would choose to turn herself in rather than risk her friends' lives. This theory was later confirmed to be exactly what happened, revealing Robin's deep care for her nakama despite her apparent cold dismissal of them.",

    "summary": "Fans theorized that the mysterious figure Usopp saw repairing the Going Merry in Skypiea was the ship's spirit (Klabautermann), proving the ship is truly alive and loved by its crew.",
    "fullText": "Following Usopp's encounter in Skypiea where he saw a mysterious figure repairing the Going Merry and saying 'I'll carry everyone a little longer,' fans theorized that ships in One Piece can develop souls if they are loved enough by their crew. This theory suggested the existence of the Klabautermann, a ship spirit from nautical folklore. During the Water 7 arc, this theory is validated when Franky explains the concept to Usopp, confirming that the Going Merry's soul appeared because of the crew's love and care. This added emotional weight to Usopp's desperate attempts to save the ship in episode 241, as he's not just fighting for an object, but for a friend with a literal soul.",

    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Robin's departure isn't just about protecting the crew from CP9, but also stems from her deep-seated fear that the Straw Hats will eventually betray her like everyone else in her life.",
    "fullText": "While the immediate reason for Robin's departure is CP9's Buster Call threat, fans have theorized that Robin's decision is complicated by her traumatic past. Having been betrayed repeatedly throughout her 20-year life on the run, Robin has never learned to truly trust others. The theory suggests that Robin believes that eventually, the Straw Hats will see her as a burden (especially given her dangerous status) and betray her. By leaving on her own terms before that can happen, Robin protects herself emotionally while also saving them from the World Government. This theory explains why Robin appears so cold and final in her rejection - she's trying to make the crew hate her so they won't follow, both for their safety and to pre-emptively avoid the pain of their eventual betrayal.",
