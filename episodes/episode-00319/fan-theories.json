    "title": "Aqua Laguna Salt Comes from the All Blue",
    "theoryText": "The special salt created by the Aqua Laguna may actually come from the legendary All Blue. Banban explains that the Aqua Laguna carries water from all the world's seas, and when this water evaporates on Water 7's rooftops, it leaves behind salt with a unique flavor that vastly improves every dish. This suggests that the Aqua Laguna might be connected to or originate from the All Blue, the legendary sea where all oceans meet. The fact that this salt has fundamentally different properties from regular salt supports the theory that it contains minerals and essence from the All Blue itself.",

    "theoryText": "The revelation that Banban and Zeff were friends who both sought the All Blue suggests there may be a larger network or community of chefs and sailors who have pursued this legendary sea. Both Banban and Zeff ended up settling in specific locations (Water 7 and East Blue respectively) after their active searching days, possibly because they found clues or connections to the All Blue in those locations. This could hint that the All Blue isn't just a single location but rather a phenomenon that manifests in different ways across the world's oceans.",
