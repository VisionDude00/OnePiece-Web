The precision of his timing suggests he saw this moment before it happened.",

Koby's Observation Haki awakening and moral courage at Marineford mark him as someone who will rise to the highest ranks while maintaining his sense of justice.",

    "theory": "While Shanks is often credited with ending the war and saving Luffy, it was actually Koby's desperate scream that created the crucial pause in fighting. Kizaru, who was seconds away from destroying Law's submarine with a light beam, stopped to look at Koby during his speech. This moment's pause gave Law the time needed to submerge and escape. Without Koby's intervention, Kizaru would have killed Luffy before Shanks even arrived. Therefore, Koby is the true savior of Luffy's life at Marineford.",

      "The episode shows Kizaru preparing to fire at Law's submarine",
