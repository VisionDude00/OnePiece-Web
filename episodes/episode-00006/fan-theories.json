    "theoryText": "The name 'Chouchou' (シュシュ) is derived from the Japanese kanji 主守, which means 'to manage to protect.' This is not coincidental but a deliberate choice by Oda to represent the dog's entire character arc - his role is literally to protect and manage his master's treasure (the shop). This naming convention demonstrates Oda's attention to detail even for minor characters.",

    "theoryText": "Chouchou's story in Episode 6 serves as one of the earliest and clearest foreshadowing moments for One Piece's central theme that true treasure isn't gold or material wealth, but rather personal connections, memories, and what you choose to protect. The pet food shop has no monetary value, but to Chouchou it's priceless. This directly parallels later revelations that the One Piece treasure itself may be of great personal value but little monetary worth - it's the journey, connections, and freedom that matter.",

Chouchou fought a battle he absolutely could not win, yet he fought anyway because it wasn't about winning - it was about loyalty and standing your ground for what you love. This theme recurs throughout One Piece where characters fight impossible odds not because they can win, but because some things are worth fighting for regardless of outcome. Chouchou represents that 'something more powerful than strength - loyalty.'",

Japanese audiences would immediately recognize this reference and understand the cultural weight of Chouchou's loyalty. This demonstrates Oda's technique of incorporating Japanese cultural touchstones that carry emotional weight for his primary audience while still being universally understandable. The parallel to Hachikō elevates what could be a simple side story into something culturally significant.",

By associating this music with a genuinely heartbreaking moment involving a minor character, the anime team taught viewers what emotional tone to expect from One Piece. Every future use of Mother Sea would subconsciously remind viewers of Chouchou's loss and Luffy's compassion, creating a cumulative emotional impact throughout the series. This was a masterful early decision that paid dividends throughout 1000+ episodes.",
