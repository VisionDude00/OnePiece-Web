    "theoryText": "The theory proposes that Imu, the supreme leader of the World Government, created the mysterious giant shadows with red eyes that inhabit the Florian Triangle. Evidence includes the physical similarities between these shadows and Imu's silhouette, particularly the red eyes. Chapter 1085 shows Imu manifesting shadows of all shapes and sizes that resemble those seen in Thriller Bark. The shadows specifically target pirates, which aligns with Imu's hostility toward seafarers. The theory suggests either Imu deploys these shadows to eliminate pirates exploring dangerous waters, or there's something hidden in the Florian Triangle that the World Government wants to keep secret.",

    "theoryText": "Gecko Moria represents a shadow or dark reflection of Monkey D. Luffy - what Luffy could become if he lost his crew. The theory posits that Moria is a tragic villain whose reliance on zombies and stolen shadows stems from PTSD after watching his original crew killed in battle with Kaido. The Mysterious Four all represent corrupted versions of the Straw Hats, showing what happens when dreams are pursued through shortcuts and stolen power rather than genuine bonds and personal growth. Moria's dream to become Pirate King mirrors Luffy's, but his methods - stealing others' strength rather than building his own - highlight the contrast between genuine and corrupted ambition.",

    "theoryText": "With recent revelations about Moria's history with Kaido and Wano, some fans theorize that Moria's zombie army and shadow-stealing activities were not purely for selfish ambition, but rather a desperate attempt to amass enough power to challenge Kaido again and possibly liberate Wano. The 'Ultimate Special Zombie' he plans to create with Luffy's shadow (worth 300,000,000 in fighting power) could represent his attempt to create a warrior strong enough to defeat a Yonko. This reframes Moria not as a simple villain, but as someone who chose morally questionable methods to achieve what he saw as a righteous goal - avenging his fallen crew and stopping Kaido.",

    "theoryText": "A logical question arises: if people who lose their shadows are destroyed by sunlight, why does Moria release them back to sea where they'll inevitably die? The theory suggests several possibilities: 1) Moria is cruel and enjoys their suffering, 2) The victims serve as warnings to other pirates about Thriller Bark's danger, 3) Moria doesn't want corpses piling up on his ship, or 4) There's a strategic reason to spread fear about the Florian Triangle. The discussion also explores whether shadowless victims could survive if they simply stayed in darkness indefinitely, or if there are other factors at play beyond just sunlight exposure.",
