3. **Voice Actor Information** - Complete voice actor credits for minor Franky Family members were not available in sources consulted.

4. **External Media** - Limited YouTube analysis videos specifically for Episode 231 were found. Most Water 7 content focuses on the arc as a whole rather than individual episodes.
