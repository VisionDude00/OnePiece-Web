# Research Notes for Episode 590

## Episode Overview
Episode 590 is a unique special crossover episode titled "History's Strongest Collaboration vs. Glutton of the Sea" that aired on April 7, 2013. It is part of the "Dream 9: Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!" celebrating Toriko's second anniversary.

## Special Considerations

### Non-Canon Status
- This episode is **NOT CANON** to the One Piece manga or main storyline
- It is a special anime-only crossover event
- Does not advance the One Piece plot in any meaningful way
- Should be treated as supplementary/promotional content rather than core series material

### Unique Production Circumstances
- **Only One Piece episode never released on home video** due to complex licensing rights involving three different anime properties
- Split broadcast: Part 1 was Toriko Episode 99, Part 2 was One Piece Episode 590
- Originally aired only once on Japanese television (April 7, 2013)
- English dub didn't air until March 4, 2023, on Toonami (nearly 10 years later)
- Finally became available on Netflix in November 2024 for North America and Latin America

### Arc Placement
- Aired during the **Punk Hazard arc** timeline (between episodes 579-625)
- Interrupts the Punk Hazard arc narrative flow
- Episodes 579-589 are Punk Hazard, then 590 is the crossover, then 591+ continues Punk Hazard
- **Arc Name**: Listed as "Special Crossover" rather than "Punk Hazard" to avoid confusion
- **Saga Name**: Technically part of Fish-Man Island Saga timeline

### Opening/Ending Song Confusion
- Episode 590 was the **last episode to use "We Go!"** by Hiroshi Kitadani
- However, it was used as an **ENDING THEME** instead of opening theme for this special
- No traditional opening sequence due to the special nature of the crossover format

## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Access
- **Could not find a full episode script** in English or Japanese
- Had to rely on wiki summaries, plot descriptions, and video analyses
- Timestamps are approximate based on plot summaries rather than exact script timing
- Some dialogue may not be exact verbatim quotes

### Crossover Complexity
- Characters from three different anime universes appear
- Only documented **One Piece characters** in detail per research instructions
- Did not create character entries for Dragon Ball Z or Toriko characters
- IGO (International Gourmet Organization) documented as it drives the plot

### Limited Detailed Information
- Exact animation quality assessments difficult without frame-by-frame analysis
- Some voice actor credits incomplete
- Limited fan theory content because episode is non-canon
- YouTube content searches didn't yield many specific video analyses

## Notable Exclusions

### No Traditional One Piece Elements
- **No new devil fruits debut** (Gomu Gomu no Mi already known)
- **No new ships appear**
- **No canonical One Piece locations** (IGO Tournament Island is from Toriko universe)
- **No character development** that carries forward into main series
- **No crew changes** or meaningful character relationships established

### Limited Fan Engagement
- **Fan theories array is empty** - episode is non-canon so no theories about future implications
- Most fan discussion focused on licensing issues and accessibility rather than story content
- Critical reception was mixed, with complaints about pacing and shallow character interactions

## Data Quality Notes

### High Confidence Data
✅ Episode number, title, air dates
✅ Basic plot summary and event sequence
✅ Character appearances (One Piece cast)
✅ Production credits (director, animation director, screenplay)
✅ Distribution history and licensing issues
✅ Voice actors (both Japanese and English)
✅ External media coverage

### Medium Confidence Data
⚠️ Exact timestamps (approximate based on summaries)
⚠️ Specific dialogue quotes (limited direct access to script)
⚠️ Some technique details (Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gatling usage)
⚠️ Animation quality assessment

### Low Confidence / Unable to Verify
❌ Detailed frame-by-frame animation analysis
❌ Complete key animator credits
❌ Exact manga chapter comparisons (episode is anime-original)
❌ Specific YouTube video content (couldn't access individual videos)

## Important Observations

### Historical Significance
This episode represents:
1. **First three-way crossover** between One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, and Toriko
2. **Third collaboration** between One Piece and Toriko overall
3. **Unique distribution history** - the "lost" One Piece episode that took 10+ years to become widely accessible
4. **Christopher R. Sabat's triple role** in English dub (Zoro, Vegeta, Piccolo)

### Technical Achievement
- Successfully blended three different animation styles
- Coordinated voice actors across multiple franchises
- Maintained character personalities from all three series
- Created a coherent plot that justified bringing three universes together

### Critical Reception
- **IMDb Rating**: 6.3/10
- **Anime News Network**: 6.710/10 (Good−)
- **TV Rating in Japan**: 8.3% (Ranked #3 in timeslot)
- Mixed reviews from critics: praised fan service, criticized pacing and shallow interactions

## Recommendations for Future Research

If more detailed research is needed:
1. **Watch the full episode** with timestamp tracking for exact event timing
2. **Access original Japanese script** if available for accurate dialogue
3. **Frame-by-frame analysis** for animation quality and sakuga moments
4. **Interview sources** with production staff if available
5. **Deep dive into licensing history** for complete distribution timeline

## Questions / Blockers

### Resolved During Research
- ✅ Confirmed episode is non-canon to One Piece
- ✅ Clarified "We Go!" was used as ending, not opening
- ✅ Found English dub voice cast information
- ✅ Confirmed episode's rare distribution status

### Unresolved / Requires Human Review
- ❓ Should crossover characters (Goku, Toriko, etc.) have minimal character entries?
  - **Decision**: Did NOT create entries as they're not One Piece characters
- ❓ How to handle the "arc" classification for a crossover special?
  - **Decision**: Used "Special Crossover" as arc name, "Fish-Man Island Saga" as saga
- ❓ Should Devil Fruit file include Gomu Gomu no Mi even though it's not a debut?
  - **Decision**: Left devil-fruits.json empty as no new fruits debut
- ❓ What spoiler severity for non-canon content?
  - **Decision**: Used MINOR for most events, MAJOR for technique debuts and battles

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

All required research and documentation has been completed to the best extent possible given the episode's unique nature as a non-canon crossover special. The main limitation is the lack of a complete episode script, which necessitated approximate timestamps and limited direct dialogue quotes. However, all major plot points, character appearances, and events have been thoroughly documented with proper source citations.
