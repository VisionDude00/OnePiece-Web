    "theoryTitle": "Cindry's Will Foreshadows Brook's Shadow Recovery",
    "theoryText": "Cindry's ability to resist her zombie programming when her original consciousness surfaces suggests that strong willpower or emotional connections can override Moria's shadow manipulation. This foreshadows that the Straw Hats' shadows might similarly resist their zombie bodies, and particularly hints at how Brook will eventually reclaim his shadow through determination and his connection to his past.",

    "theoryText": "Hogback represents a cautionary tale about medical professionals who lose sight of their oath to do no harm. His transformation from world-renowned surgeon to mad scientist mirrors real-world concerns about unethical medical experimentation. The fact that Chopper, who represents proper medical ethics, explicitly rejects him suggests Oda is making a statement about the importance of consent, dignity, and the sanctity of life in medical practice.",

    "theoryTitle": "Cindry's Hatred of Plates Has Deeper Meaning",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Cindry's programmed hatred of plates (shown in earlier episodes) relates to her death - perhaps she died at a celebration dinner or her rejection of Hogback happened over a meal. Her consciousness breaking through when confronted with concepts of freedom suggests her plate-breaking compulsion was her subconscious fighting against her imprisonment in zombie form.",
