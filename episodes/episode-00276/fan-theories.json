    "theoryText": "Many fans theorized that Jaguar D. Saul survived the Buster Call and the ice attack from Aokiji. The theory suggested that Saul was frozen but not killed, and that he might return later in the story. This theory was later confirmed in the manga when it was revealed that Saul protected Ohara's books in Elbaf's Owl Library for 22 years.",

This was confirmed when it was revealed that Saul and the giants preserved Ohara's library in Elbaf.",

The World Government's extreme reaction (Buster Call genocide) indicates they had found something truly threatening to the current world order, not just that they were researching forbidden topics.",

This was later confirmed when it was revealed that Vegapunk secretly traveled to Elbaf to read the salvaged Ohara books.",

If Olvia had reunited with Robin before the Buster Call, Robin might have had different memories and motivations.
