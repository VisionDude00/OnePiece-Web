    "theory": "This theory proposes that the island where Hiriluk experienced his miraculous healing through cherry blossoms was actually God Valley. The evidence includes: (1) Hiriluk mentioned the miracle happened in 'a faraway land in the West,' and Chapter 1095 confirmed God Valley was in the West Blue; (2) The connection between cherry blossoms and liberation/revolution, as Dragon and the Revolutionaries are introduced in a chapter called 'Skull and Cherry Blossoms'; (3) The symbolic importance of cherry blossoms representing freedom and change throughout One Piece.",

The theory suggests Wano might have deeper connections to the Drum Island arc beyond surface similarities, possibly relating to the nature of healing and power in One Piece.",

The theory notes that Hiriluk was a thief who changed after seeing cherry blossoms, and Rocks disappeared after God Valley. However, this theory is considered unlikely by most fans and lacks substantial evidence.",

The theory proposes that this moment establishes the framework for understanding inherited will, the importance of dreams, and why certain characters' deaths have lasting impact while they live on through those who remember them. This theme recurs with characters like Ace, Whitebeard, and others.",
