    "theoryText": "When Blackbeard states he's hunting 'one man worth 100 million' in Episode 151, many fans theorized he was actually targeting Portgas D. Ace, not Luffy. While both had bounties around 100 million at this time, Blackbeard's strategic goal of becoming a Warlord required capturing someone significant - and Ace, as Whitebeard's 2nd Division Commander, would be a much more valuable prize to the World Government than the relatively unknown Luffy.",

    "theoryText": "Based on Laffitte's ability to sprout wings and his later demonstrated hypnosis powers, fans theorize he possesses a Mythical Zoan fruit based on the Siren from Greek mythology. Sirens in Greek mythology were bird-women hybrids known for their hypnotic voices that could control people - perfectly matching Laffitte's demonstrated abilities of flight and hypnosis. His wings appearing white and angelic supports the bird-woman connection, and his ability to infiltrate Mary Geoise undetected suggests supernatural stealth abilities.",

Fans theorized early on that they might be immortal, possibly through the Ope Ope no Mi's immortality surgery. Their extensive knowledge of world events spanning centuries and their apparent unchanging appearance in flashbacks suggested they had lived far longer than normal humans. This theory gained traction as more was revealed about the Ope Ope no Mi's ultimate ability.",

At the time, the exact mechanism wasn't clear, but fans immediately theorized he had some kind of puppet-control ability.

Both are D. clan members, both have grand ambitions (Pirate King), both value dreams highly, and both are gathering crews. However, their philosophies diverge - where Luffy values friendship and freedom, Blackbeard seems willing to betray and manipulate to achieve his goals. Fans theorized that Blackbeard represents what Luffy could become if he abandoned his morals, making them narrative foils destined for a final confrontation.",
