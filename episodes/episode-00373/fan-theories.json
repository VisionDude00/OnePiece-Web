    "theory": "Moria's strategic mistake in using Luffy's shadow for Oars was a critical error. Luffy's indomitable will made it much harder for Oars to fully follow Moria's commands compared to other zombie essences. If Moria had used a more obedient shadow, Oars might have been more effective in battle.",

    "theory": "The shadow memory transfer mechanics in Thriller Bark are inconsistent. When Lola received her shadow back, she remembered 'Namizo,' implying memories are reciprocated to original hosts. However, this wasn't observed in the Straw Hats including Luffy despite his shadow being in Oars for an extended period. This could suggest different levels of memory transfer based on how long the shadow is separated.",

    "theory": "Moria's Shadows Asgard technique represents the ultimate glass cannon power-up. While it grants him incredible strength (1,000 shadows vs Nightmare Luffy's 100), the grotesque transformation and loss of all his zombie forces suggests this technique has severe drawbacks beyond just the physical strain. The technique might be unsustainable for extended periods or have other hidden costs.",
