# Research Notes for Episode 226

## Episode Overview
Episode 226: "The Guy Who's the Closest to Invincible? And the Most Dangerous Man!" is a pivotal transitional episode that concludes the anime-original Foxy's Return arc and introduces one of the most important characters in One Piece - Admiral Aokiji (Kuzan).

## Research Process

### Sources Used
- **Primary Source**: One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Episode 226 page
- **Character Info**: Kuzan wiki page, Hie Hie no Mi wiki page
- **External Reviews**: Tumblr blog recaps, Bilibili reactions, Spotify podcast
- **Production Info**: IMDb, Wikipedia season 7 page
- **Voice Actors**: Behind The Voice Actors database

### Key Findings

#### Episode Structure
The episode is divided into two distinct parts:
1. **First Half (Minutes 0-15)**: Conclusion of Foxy's Return filler arc
   - Foxy traps Straw Hats with Noro Noro Beam
   - Nami debuts Thunderstorm Tempo
   - Luffy debuts Gomu Gomu no Koma
   - Foxy defeated
   - Foxy's crew accepts him back

2. **Second Half (Minutes 16-23)**: Aokiji Introduction (Canon Content)
   - Straw Hats land on Long Ring Long Land
   - Foxy's final crab submarine attack
   - Journey into jungle
   - Discovery of bicycle tracks
   - **CRITICAL**: First appearance of Admiral Aokiji
   - Robin's terrified reaction
   - Aokiji recognizes Robin

#### Animation Quality Notes
- Standard animation quality overall
- **Animation Errors Noted**: HDTV version contains errors including:
  - Zoro appearing in two locations simultaneously
  - Inconsistencies in Nami's weather attack sequences

#### Filler vs Canon Confusion
- Episodes 225-228 are listed as "Foxy's Return Arc" which is anime-original filler
- **However**: Episode 226 contains the canon introduction of Aokiji
- This creates a unique situation where a "filler" episode contains critical canon content
- The Foxy content is filler, but Aokiji's appearance is from manga Chapter 303

#### Debut Confusion
- Different sources list Aokiji's debut as either Episode 225, 226, or 227
- **Clarification**:
  - Episode 225: Possible brief appearance/mention
  - Episode 226: Physical first appearance (sleeping in jungle)
  - Episode 227: Full introduction with powers revealed
- For incremental research purposes, Episode 226 is marked as his debut since it's his first physical on-screen appearance

#### Voice Actor Information
- **Aokiji Japanese VA**: Takehito Koyasu (confirmed)
  - NOTE: Some searches incorrectly suggested Kouichi Yamadera
  - Takehito Koyasu is famous for voicing Dio Brando in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
- **Aokiji English VA**: Jason Douglas (Funimation dub)

### Technique Debuts

#### Thunderstorm Tempo (Nami)
- First advanced weather manipulation technique shown by Nami
- Creates "angry raincloud of epic proportions"
- Neutralizes Foxy's fiery boxing gloves and mechanical weapons
- Demonstrates Nami's growth as combatant

#### Gomu Gomu no Koma (Luffy)
- Spinning top technique
- Shows continued innovation with rubber powers
- Creative application of Devil Fruit abilities

#### Kani Kani Punch (Foxy)
- Limited information available
- Appears to be crab-themed punching attack
- Proved ineffective against Straw Hats

### Significant Story Elements

#### Robin's Fear
- **CRITICAL OBSERVATION**: Robin displays unprecedented terror
- Crew has never seen her react this way
- Suggests traumatic past connection to Aokiji
- Foreshadows Ohara incident backstory (confirmed in later episodes)

#### Aokiji's Comment
- "You've grown into a beautiful woman"
- Confirms he knew Robin as a child
- Heavily implies connection to Ohara tragedy
- Sets up future backstory revelations

#### Power Hierarchy Introduction
- Robin explains concept of Marine Admirals
- Establishes three Admirals as World Government's greatest weapons
- Creates immediate sense of danger for Straw Hats
- Power gap clearly established

### Reception and Rating

#### IMDb Rating: 6.5/10
- Below series average
- Likely due to Foxy filler content
- Despite containing important Aokiji introduction

#### Fan Reception
- Foxy's Return arc generally unpopular with fans
- Seen as unnecessary filler
- However, Aokiji introduction highly praised
- Creates interesting dichotomy for this episode

### Production Notes

#### Timing
- Aired March 20, 2005 in Japan
- Nearly 7 months after original Davy Back Fight
- Positioned right before Water 7 arc
- Likely created to prevent anime from catching up to manga

#### Opening/Ending
- **Opening**: "Kokoro no Chizu" by BOYSTYLE (eps 207-263)
  - Fifth opening theme
  - First One Piece opening in widescreen
  - Title translates to "Map of the Heart"

- **Ending**: "Mirai Koukai" by Tackey & Tsubasa (eps 207-230)

### Additional Observations

1. **Episode Importance**: Despite being technically part of a filler arc, this episode is critically important for introducing Aokiji, who becomes a major character in the series.

2. **Tonal Shift**: Episode demonstrates dramatic tonal shift - first half is comedic filler, second half introduces serious threat and mystery.

3. **Robin's Character Development**: This is a rare moment showing Robin vulnerable and afraid, adding depth to her character.

4. **Power Scaling**: Introduction of Admirals establishes clear power hierarchy that affects story for hundreds of episodes.

5. **Foreshadowing**: Bicycle tracks and Robin's fear effectively build tension before Aokiji's reveal.

### Recommendations for Future Research

1. Episodes 227-228 should be researched next to complete the Aokiji introduction arc
2. Later episodes revealing Ohara incident should cross-reference this episode
3. Water 7/Enies Lobby arc episodes should reference Robin's fear established here
4. Future Aokiji appearances should callback to this debut
