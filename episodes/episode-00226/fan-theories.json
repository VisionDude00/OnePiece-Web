    "theoryText": "Based on Robin's extreme fear upon seeing Aokiji and his comment about her growing into a beautiful woman, fans theorize that Aokiji was present during the Ohara incident when Robin was a child. The theory suggests that despite being a Marine, Aokiji may have shown mercy to young Robin, allowing her to escape the Buster Call that destroyed Ohara. This would explain why Robin recognizes him and fears him, yet he doesn't immediately arrest her.",
