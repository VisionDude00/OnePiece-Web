    "summary": "Based on Joy Boy's apology revealed in this episode, fans theorize that Luffy will be the one to fulfill Joy Boy's ancient promise to Fish-Man Island, potentially bringing them to the surface to live with humans.",
    "fullText": "When Robin discovers Joy Boy's apology on the Poneglyph in Episode 548, it reveals that Joy Boy made a promise to Fish-Man Island involving the massive ship Noah but failed to keep it. Fans theorize that Luffy, who shares many parallels with Joy Boy, is destined to fulfill this promise. The theory suggests that Luffy will eventually use Noah to transport the Fish-Men and Merfolk to the surface, fulfilling Otohime's dream of coexistence and completing Joy Boy's broken promise from the Void Century. This would explain why Noah must be preserved and why the Sea Kings protect it.",

    "summary": "The apology to Fish-Man Island is theorized to be specifically directed at Poseidon, the ancient weapon. Joy Boy's promise may have required the cooperation of the previous Poseidon, and his failure affected the entire island.",
    "fullText": "Episode 548 reveals Joy Boy's apology but doesn't specify who it's addressed to. Fans theorize that the apology is specifically directed at the ancient weapon Poseidon, which is revealed to be passed down through the Ryugu royal family. Joy Boy may have made a pact with the previous Poseidon (likely a mermaid princess like Shirahoshi) to use Noah for a specific purpose, possibly to bring Fish-Men to the surface or evacuate them during a catastrophe. When Joy Boy failed, the promise couldn't be fulfilled, affecting all of Fish-Man Island. This theory is supported by Neptune's knowledge of the promise being passed down through the royal family, who are connected to Poseidon.",

    "fullText": "In Episode 548, Hody forces citizens to step on portraits of Queen Otohime, a practice called fumi-e that references Japanese Christian persecution. Fans theorize this scene foreshadows similar conflicts later in the series where characters must publicly renounce their beliefs or face consequences. The parallel to religious persecution suggests themes about the suppression of ideology and the courage required to maintain one's convictions. Some theorize this could relate to the World Government's suppression of the Will of D or knowledge of the Void Century, where people might be forced to denounce 'dangerous' historical truths.",
