Roger reaching Laugh Tale and his contemplative thoughts about whether the Straw Hats are 'the ones Roger was waiting for,' many fans theorized that Crocus was actually a member of the Roger Pirates. His role as a doctor and his position at the entrance to the Grand Line seemed too convenient to be coincidental.",
