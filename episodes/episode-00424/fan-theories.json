    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Captain John, as a former member of the Rocks Pirates, might have possessed information about Ancient Weapons or Road Poneglyphs. His legendary treasure that Buggy seeks might not just be gold and jewels, but could contain crucial information about the Void Century or the location of Laugh Tale. This would explain why the treasure is considered so legendary and why it's been sought after for so long.",

The torture methods on each level (fire, beasts, heat, freezing, etc.) might foreshadow the abilities of the Five Elders who were revealed to have mythical Zoan fruits. Level 1's Crimson Hell with its blade trees could represent one Elder's power over cutting/slashing abilities.",
