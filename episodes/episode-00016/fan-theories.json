    "theory": "Kuro's Shakushi technique shown in Episode 16 operates at approximately the same speed as CP9's Soru technique that appears much later in the series. Some fans theorize that Kuro may have been aware of or independently developed a technique similar to the Rokushiki's Soru, but without the control and mastery that CP9 agents possess. This would make Kuro an early example of someone using an advanced technique that would later become central to the series' power system.",

Some fans theorize that Pandaman is not just an easter egg but will eventually have plot significance in One Piece. His appearances across different crews, locations, and time periods suggest he may be an immortal character, a time traveler, or represents something meta-textual about the One Piece world itself. His bounty of 3,333,333 Berry (a significant number) and his mysterious backstory of being chased by the Tomato Gang add to the intrigue.",

Both captains are willing to sacrifice their crew for their own ambitions, both have elaborate plans, and both represent a dark mirror to Luffy's leadership philosophy.
