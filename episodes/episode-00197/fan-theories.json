    "theoryText": "Fans frequently express desire for Vice Admiral Jonathan to appear in the canon storyline, given his compelling characterization, tactical intelligence, and laid-back personality that contrasts with other Marine officers. Some theorize he could appear during major Marine operations or gatherings, similar to how other non-canon characters have been referenced or included in canon material.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 197's emphasis on Sanji teaching about not wasting food is a deliberate callback to his backstory with Zeff on the rock, where they survived on minimal food and learned the value of every ingredient. Fans note this episode as one of the strongest displays of how Zeff's teachings shaped Sanji's identity as a chef, not just a fighter.",
