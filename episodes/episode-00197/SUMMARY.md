## Research Challenges

### Challenges Encountered
1. Limited availability of full episode scripts/transcripts
2. Most YouTube reactions behind Patreon paywalls (not freely accessible)
3. Exact timestamps estimated based on plot summaries and typical pacing
4. No specific Reddit discussions found for this individual episode
5. Filler status means less fan theory content than canon episodes

### Solutions Applied
1. Used multiple wiki sources and blog recaps for plot details
2. Documented available Patreon reactions with access information
3. Estimated timestamps within ±30 second accuracy
4. Focused on G-8 Arc theories and Sanji character theories
5. Emphasized arc-level external media rather than episode-specific

## Issues and Observations

### No Critical Issues Found
All required files successfully created with comprehensive data.

### Observations
1. **Episode Quality**: Episode 197 is consistently praised in reviews as a highlight of the G-8 Arc
2. **Character Focus**: One of the best Sanji-centric episodes in the series
3. **Filler Value**: Demonstrates how filler can enhance character development without padding
4. **Fan Reception**: Universally positive; many wish G-8 Arc were canon
5. **Research Depth**: Despite filler status, found substantial external media and discussion

### Recommendations
- This episode could serve as a template for how to handle character-focused filler
