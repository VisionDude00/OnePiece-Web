    "theoryText": "Given that Rayleigh emphasized Conqueror's Haki can only be strengthened through personal growth rather than training, fans theorized that Luffy's two-year training would focus not just on physical abilities but on maturing as a person and leader. The theory suggests that by the end of training, Luffy would develop advanced applications of Conqueror's Haki beyond just knocking out weak-willed opponents.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorized that the 500 beasts on Rusukaina, all stronger than Luffy at the start, were intentionally chosen by Rayleigh as progressive training challenges. The theory suggests each beast might require different applications of Haki to defeat, with the weakest beasts testing basic Observation and Armament Haki, while the strongest would require mastery of all three types or advanced techniques.",

Since Rayleigh was Roger's first mate, his knowledge of what it takes to conquer the Grand Line and reach Laugh Tale would inform his training curriculum. This theory suggests that Rayleigh is essentially creating the next Pirate King using lessons learned from his time with Roger.",
