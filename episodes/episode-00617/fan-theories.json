    "summary": "A theory that Caesar Clown could eventually become a member of the Straw Hat crew, based on foreshadowing and his continued involvement with the crew after Punk Hazard.",
    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that Caesar Clown could become the next Straw Hat crew member. Evidence cited includes foreshadowing panels, such as Franky wearing a t-shirt with the letters 'JK' after the Punk Hazard arc, with 'J' potentially referencing Jinbe and 'K' referencing Caesar (from the Japanese spelling 'Kuraun'). Despite his villainous actions, Caesar continues to travel with the Straw Hats in later arcs, leading some to speculate this could be building toward eventual redemption and membership.",

    "fullText": "Some fans have theorized that Caesar's Devil Fruit abilities are already awakened, pointing to his ability to manipulate and create various types of gases, merge with external gases like Shinokuni, and control gas on a massive scale. The theory suggests that his scientific knowledge combined with awakening allows him to perform feats beyond normal Logia capabilities, such as removing oxygen from large areas and transforming the environment around him into poisonous gas.",
