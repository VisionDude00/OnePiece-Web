## Key Findings

### Major Events
1. **Law vs Vergo Conclusion** - Law finally defeats Vergo after retrieving his heart, demonstrating incredible resolve despite severe injuries
2. **Law Cuts Punk Hazard** - One of the most visually impressive feats in the series up to this point, cutting mountains and facility in half
3. **Grizzly Magnum Debut** - First appearance of this signature Gear 3 + Haki combination attack
4. **Caesar's True Nature Revealed** - His willingness to kill his own subordinates solidifies him as a despicable villain

- The anime extended the clash between Caesar's Shinokuni form and Luffy's Grizzly Magnum for dramatic effect
