    "theory": "When Luffy appears with the giant golden ball during his battle with Enel, he calls it 'Sunny' and uses it to defeat the self-proclaimed god. This was intentional foreshadowing by Oda of Luffy's true nature as the Sun God Nika. The visual of Luffy with the golden sphere resembling the sun, combined with defeating a false god, mirrors his eventual awakening and role in defeating the World Government.",

    "theory": "The battle between Luffy and Enel in Skypiea is a smaller-scale version of the final battle against Imu and the World Government. Enel's use of the Ark Maxim foreshadows Imu's use of the ancient weapon Uranus. Just as Luffy defeated the 'god' Enel who planned to destroy Skypiea, Luffy (as Nika) will defeat Imu who controls the world from above. The golden ball that Enel uses to defeat Luffy becomes the weapon that brings his downfall, similar to how the World Government's own power structures may lead to their defeat.",

    "publishDate": "Unknown",
    "theory": "Nami's declaration in Episode 184 that she would rather have nothing than be without her crew represents a microcosm of One Piece's central theme. Her journey from valuing treasure above all (due to trauma from Arlong) to valuing nakama above material wealth mirrors Luffy's philosophy that the journey and bonds are more valuable than the destination. This moment solidifies that the 'One Piece' itself is likely not a treasure in the traditional sense, but rather the connections and adventure along the way.",

    "publishDate": "Unknown",
    "theory": "Luffy's use of the golden ball wasn't just about weight and momentum - it was a calculated decision to use gold as an electrical conductor to absorb and redirect Enel's Raigo attack. What appeared to be Luffy's defeat in Episode 184 was actually setting up his victory. This demonstrates that Luffy, despite his seemingly simple-minded nature, has significant combat intelligence and can turn his opponents' weapons against them.",

    "publishDate": "Unknown",
    "theory": "The Skypiea arc contains numerous hints about the origin of Devil Fruits and their connection to ancient civilizations. Enel's mastery over his fruit and the ancient technology of the Ark Maxim suggest a deeper connection between the sky islands and the Void Century. The golden ball scene represents the intersection of Devil Fruit powers and ancient materials, hinting at how these powers were created or distributed in ancient times.",
