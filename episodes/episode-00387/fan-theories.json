    "theory": "Nami's compassionate decision to save Hatchan despite her trauma with the Arlong Pirates serves as important foreshadowing for the Fish-Man Island arc. Her ability to separate Hatchan as an individual from her hatred of Arlong demonstrates that she doesn't harbor prejudice against all fish-men, which becomes crucial later when the crew visits Fish-Man Island and confronts the complex issues of racism and prejudice in that arc.",

    "title": "Hatchan's Redemption Arc Was Planned from East Blue",
    "theory": "The fact that Hatchan was the only member of the Arlong Pirates to escape Marine capture wasn't random - it was intentionally set up by Oda to allow for his redemption arc. Unlike the other Arlong Pirates who were portrayed as purely villainous, Hatchan was shown to be more comedic and less malicious, making him the perfect candidate to return as a reformed character who could bridge the gap between the Straw Hats and the fish-man community.",

    "title": "The Crew's Silent Agreement Shows True Respect",
    "theory": "The way the entire crew implicitly deferred to Nami's decision about rescuing Hatchan - without anyone explicitly stating that it was her choice - demonstrates the deep level of understanding and respect they have for each other's trauma. No one needed to say 'Nami, it's your decision' because they all understood without words. This silent communication shows how close the Straw Hats have become and how well they understand each other's pain.",

    "theory": "When Luffy asks Hatchan about the quality of his takoyaki before leaving, it seems like a random food-obsessed question, but it actually reveals Luffy's deeper character. He's already decided that if Hatchan has genuinely changed and is pursuing a peaceful dream, he deserves a second chance. The question about takoyaki is Luffy's way of giving Hatchan an opportunity to prove he's different now. Luffy judges people by their dreams and current actions, not their past.",
