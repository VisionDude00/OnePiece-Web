Law is using the threat of Kaido to corner Doflamingo, knowing that either choice (resigning from Shichibukai or facing Kaido) will lead to Doflamingo's downfall.",

    "discussion": "Many fans suspected from the beginning that Law's plan to defeat Kaido was not his true objective. The theory gained traction after this episode, where Law's ultimatum clearly targets Doflamingo personally. Fans noted that Law seemed more invested in destroying Doflamingo than actually facing Kaido. This theory was later confirmed in the Dressrosa Arc when Law's true motivations regarding Corazon were revealed.",
    "counterArguments": "Some fans believed Law genuinely wanted to take down a Yonko to establish himself in the New World, and that revenge on Doflamingo was a secondary benefit.",

    "theory": "The 30% success rate Law mentions is actually higher than it seems because Law is intentionally lowballing the odds to manage Luffy's expectations. Law knows Luffy will charge ahead regardless, so he's preparing him for the worst while secretly believing they have a better chance.",
