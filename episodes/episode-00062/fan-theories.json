    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Brook had plenty of time during the two-year timeskip to return to Reverse Mountain and reunite with Laboon. Since Brook's dream was to see Laboon again, he may have already fulfilled this promise off-screen. This theory suggests that Brook may eventually sacrifice himself for the crew since he's already achieved his primary goal.",

Some fans claim the treasure is actually related to Joy Boy, and that a massive whale similar to Laboon exists under Long Ring Long Land, potentially hiding the One Piece. The theory connects the Rumbar Pirates' journey to the ultimate treasure.",

This theory was later confirmed when it was revealed that Crocus served as the doctor on Roger's ship.",

Early theories suggested they died from disease, were killed by enemies, or got trapped somewhere in the Grand Line. The introduction of Laboon's story made fans expect that the Rumbar Pirates' fate would be a tragic reveal that would connect to a future Straw Hat member.",
