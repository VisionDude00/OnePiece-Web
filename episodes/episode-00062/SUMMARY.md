## Synopsis

Upon successfully navigating down Reverse Mountain, the Straw Hat Pirates enter the Grand Line only to encounter a massive Island Whale named Laboon blocking their path. With their helm broken, the Going Merry crashes into the whale and is subsequently swallowed whole. Inside Laboon's bizarre interior, which contains an artificial island environment complete with sky and ocean, the crew meets Crocus, the 71-year-old lighthouse keeper who has been caring for the whale for 50 years.

Crocus reveals Laboon's tragic history: the whale has been waiting five decades for the Rumbar Pirates to return, continuously ramming his head against the Red Line in grief and hope. The crew also encounters two mysterious individuals, Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday, who reveal themselves as Baroque Works agents planning to kill Laboon for his meat.
