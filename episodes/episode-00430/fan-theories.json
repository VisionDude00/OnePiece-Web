    "theoryText": "After seeing Jinbe's honorable character and his willingness to sacrifice his Warlord position for his principles, fans theorized that Jinbe would eventually join Luffy's crew. His introduction as a principled warrior who values loyalty and his clear opposition to the World Government's methods made him seem like a natural fit for the Straw Hats. The theory suggested that after the war, Jinbe would need a new purpose and would align with Luffy's goals.",
