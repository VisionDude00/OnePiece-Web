    "theoryTitle": "The Calm Belt Introduction Was Strategic Foreshadowing",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that introducing the Calm Belt in this filler arc was a deliberate decision by the anime production team to foreshadow its importance later in the series. By introducing it earlier than the manga (where it appears at Reverse Mountain), the anime subtly plants the concept in viewers' minds before it becomes crucial to the plot.",

    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized that the Warship Island Arc was created as a buffer to prevent the anime from catching up to the manga too quickly after the emotionally intense Arlong Park Arc and before the important Loguetown Arc. This would give the manga time to progress while keeping anime viewers engaged.",
