    "summary": "A theory suggesting Caesar Clown could become the next nakama (crew member) of the Straw Hat Pirates, which gained traction after the Punk Hazard arc.",
    "fullText": "Some fans believe Caesar Clown could join the Straw Hat Pirates based on several points: (1) The dynamics between Caesar and the Straw Hats are incredible, with Caesar becoming an expendable punching bag that brings laughter to the crew. (2) Franky's t-shirt with letters 'JK' might have foreshadowed both Jinbe (J) and Caesar (K, from the Japanese spelling 'Kuraun' for Clown). (3) If the Straw Hats travel to space (a popular fan theory), Caesar might help them, as astronomy books and planet replicas were seen in Punk Hazard. The theory gained popularity after Luffy and the alliance kidnapped Caesar at the end of the Punk Hazard Arc.",

    "fullText": "A Reddit user theorized that clown-like characters in One Piece, including Caesar Clown and Buggy, could be a rare race similar to Buccaneers or Lunarians. The theory notes that three rare races have been introduced in the series that have been hunted down by the World Government or discriminated against, and suggests that clowns could be another such race. This would explain certain unique characteristics and the recurring clown motif in the series.",

    "fullText": "The reason the Dragons survived the Shinokuni poison from four years ago when Caesar activated his weapon and the battle between Sakazuki and Kuzan could be the result of having Kaido's DNA. This theory suggests that Vegapunk's dragon experiments may have used Kaido's DNA to create the artificial dragons, which could explain their resilience and survival of the Shinokuni gas that petrifies other organic life. This would connect Punk Hazard's experiments to one of the Four Emperors and suggest a deeper relationship between Vegapunk's research and the Yonko.",

    "fullText": "Fan theories abound relating to Caesar's future role in the One Piece story. Some speculate that he'll play a key function in future arcs, significantly if there's a focus on the creation of Devil Fruits or the additional exploration of scientific research within the world. Given Caesar's expertise in chemical weapons, gas manipulation, and his knowledge of SMILE artificial Devil Fruits, fans believe he possesses unique knowledge about Devil Fruit creation that could become crucial later in the series. This theory suggests Caesar's survival and continued presence in the story isn't just for comic relief, but because his scientific knowledge will be needed.",
