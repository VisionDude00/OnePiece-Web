    "theoryText": "When viewers first saw the living toys in Episode 630, many fans immediately speculated that these toys were not simply animated objects, but actually transformed humans. The theory suggested that a Devil Fruit user on Dressrosa had the power to turn people into toys, possibly erasing memories of their human existence. This would explain why the toys seem so lifelike and why Dressrosa's culture treats them as normal citizens.",

    "theoryText": "Early fan theories about Fujitora speculated on the reason for his blindness. Some fans theorized that he wasn't born blind or injured in battle, but rather chose to blind himself intentionally, possibly after witnessing something so horrible that he no longer wanted to see the world's corruption and cruelty. This would fit with his calm, philosophical demeanor and his presence in Dressrosa, a place with hidden darkness beneath its beautiful surface.",

The presence of living toys, the fact that Doflamingo's thugs openly cheat and bully people, and the overall 'too good to be true' atmosphere led to theories that Doflamingo's rule was actually tyrannical and that the island's happiness was forced or fabricated. The toys were seen as the key to uncovering Dressrosa's dark secret.",
