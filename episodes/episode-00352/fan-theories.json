    "theory": "The One Piece treasure is an afro that would allow recognition by ancient beings, similar to how Brook needs his afro for Laboon to recognize him. This theory suggests that just like Brook's desperate protection of his afro in this episode, the afro has deeper significance in the series. When Luffy wears this afro in his Gear 5 form, the giant whale under Long Ring Long Land would recognize this as the appointed time for it to carry out its ancient job, identifying the wearer as the reincarnation of Joyboy.",

    "theory": "Brook's confrontation with Zombie Ryuma is symbolic of Brook fighting his own depression and past failures personified. Ryuma, who is literally Brook's shadow, represents the part of Brook that gave up and accepted defeat five years ago. By defeating Ryuma, Brook is symbolically overcoming his own self-doubt and the weakness he displayed when he first begged for his life. The afro represents not just a physical trait but Brook's will to live and keep his promise.",

    "theory": "The reason why Ryuma's zombie was eventually defeated (in later episodes) is not because of Ryuma himself being weak, but because the zombie was fighting with Brook's swordsmanship from the shadow, which was obviously much lower in skill than the legendary samurai Ryuma's original abilities. This suggests that shadows don't transfer the original body's muscle memory or skills, only the shadow owner's abilities.",

The similarities in their fighting styles and appearance (noted when Oda drew his one-shot 'Monsters' with Ryuma looking identical to Zoro) are not coincidental. This connection is hinted at when Ryuma declares himself a 'legendary dragon-slaying swordsman' in Episode 352, foreshadowing the Wano arc revelations.",
