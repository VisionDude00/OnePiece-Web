    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Fujitora's sword has eaten the Zushi Zushi no Mi Devil Fruit, not Fujitora himself. This theory stems from the observation that Fujitora always opens his sword when using his gravity powers, suggesting the Devil Fruit powers are channeled through the blade rather than being inherent to Fujitora.",

    "theoryText": "Fans theorize that Admiral Fujitora and Monkey D. Dragon, leader of the Revolutionary Army, somehow know each other personally. The theory suggests that this connection might explain why Fujitora blinded himself - perhaps he witnessed something related to Dragon or the Revolutionary Army that affected him deeply. Their timelines and characteristics have several similarities that fuel this speculation.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Fujitora's meteor attack in Episode 643 was not actually meant to kill Law and Doflamingo, but rather was a warning shot and a test of their abilities. The theory points to Fujitora's casual statement 'I was just testing my strength a little' as evidence that he deliberately chose a meteor that could be cut, rather than using his full power. This suggests Fujitora may have ulterior motives and is gathering intelligence on the major players in Dressrosa.",

    "theoryText": "A popular theory suggests that Usopp's lie about being a descendant of Noland will somehow become true or prophetic. Throughout One Piece, many of Usopp's lies have a tendency to come true later in the story. Fans speculate that either Usopp actually has some connection to Noland that he's unaware of, or that his actions in Dressrosa will validate the lie by making him a hero to the dwarves just as Noland was.",
