    "summary": "A humorous fan theory that treats the fictional character 'Condoriano' as a real person and member of the Will of D, placing him among legendary characters like Monkey D. Luffy and Gol D. Roger.",
    "fullText": "In what started as a joke from Episode 200, fans have created an elaborate meme treating 'Condoriano' (Con D. Oriano) as if he were an actual Straw Hat crew member and a carrier of the Will of D. Despite being Inspector Shepherd who was gaslighted by Usopp and Zoro, the One Piece community has immortalized 'Condoriano' as a legendary figure, creating fan art, power scaling debates, and treating him as one of the most powerful characters in the series. This satirical theory places him alongside other joke 'D' clan members like 'Go D. Usopp' and 'Buggy D. Clown'.",

    "summary": "A popular fan opinion that the G-8 Arc, despite being filler, is so well-written that it should be considered canon or at least acknowledged in the main story.",
    "fullText": "Many One Piece fans argue that the G-8 Arc (episodes 196-206) is the best filler arc in the series and contains better writing than some canon arcs. The strategic battles between Vice Admiral Jonathan and the Straw Hats, along with memorable moments like the Condoriano scene in Episode 200, have led fans to wish this arc was part of Eiichiro Oda's original manga. Some fans theorize that since the arc was originally conceived as a movie script, it represents what official One Piece content could look like when given proper time and attention. The arc's quality has sparked discussions about whether anime-original content can sometimes surpass canon material in terms of entertainment value and character development.",
