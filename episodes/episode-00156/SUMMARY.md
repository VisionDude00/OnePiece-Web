## Episode Summary

The White Berets, led by Captain McKinley, arrive at Lovely Street to arrest the Straw Hat Pirates for illegal entry into Skypiea without paying the 1 billion extol entrance fee. When the crew refuses to pay, McKinley lists additional crimes they've committed, including Usopp using a waver (forbidden for Blue Sea people) and hitting the Express Lobster.

As tensions escalate, Nami returns from exploring the Forbidden Upper Yard on a waver and accidentally crashes into McKinley, committing what he classifies as a Class 5 crime - assault on an officer. The White Berets attack, but Luffy easily defeats them using his new technique, Gomu Gomu no Hanabi.

McKinley officially declares the Straw Hats as Class 2 criminals, meaning they must now face judgment by Enel's four Priests through the deadly "Ordeals."

This episode serves as a crucial turning point in the Skypiea Arc, transitioning from the exploration phase to active conflict with Enel's forces. It establishes:

1. The oppressive nature of Enel's rule through the crime classification system
2. The power gap between the Straw Hats and ordinary Skypiea soldiers
3. The setup for confrontations with the four Priests
4. World-building details about Skypiea's society and legal system

The introduction of the Ordeals concept foreshadows the deadly challenges ahead, while McKinley's character introduction plants seeds for his later redemption arc when he turns against Enel.

- Establishes the conflict structure for the arc
- Introduces interesting world-building through the crime system
