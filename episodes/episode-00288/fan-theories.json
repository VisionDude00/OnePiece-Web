    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Gear 3's giant-sized attacks were foreshadowed by Luffy's earlier encounters with giants like Dorry and Brogy in Little Garden, suggesting Luffy was inspired by their massive strength.",
    "fullText": "Fans have noted that Luffy's development of Gear 3 may have been partially inspired by his time with the giants Dorry and Brogy during the Little Garden arc. The technique allows him to temporarily achieve giant-sized limbs and strength, similar to the giants he befriended. This theory suggests Luffy subconsciously incorporated elements of the giants' power into his fighting style evolution.",

    "summary": "Fans appreciate that Franky's cola dependency isn't just comedy but represents his connection to American culture and serves as a balanced weakness for an otherwise overpowered cyborg.",
    "fullText": "The introduction of Franky's complete dependence on cola in episode 288 has been praised by fans as brilliant character design. The cola (an American beverage) connects to Franky's 'tough guy' American-inspired personality and design. More importantly, it provides a clear weakness and limitation for a character who could otherwise be too powerful as a cyborg with unlimited weapons. The comedic personality changes with other beverages add humor while reinforcing this fundamental character trait. This makes Franky more interesting and balanced as a fighter.",
