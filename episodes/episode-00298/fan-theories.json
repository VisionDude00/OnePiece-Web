    "theoryTitle": "Sanji's Lunarian Heritage Theory",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Sanji's ability to use Diable Jambe without harming himself is connected to Lunarian heritage. Lunarians are a race with natural fire abilities and enhanced durability when their flames are active. This theory suggests that Sanji's genetic modifications from the Vinsmoke family may have awakened latent Lunarian traits, explaining his resistance to his own flames.",

When asked why Sanji doesn't burn himself, Oda humorously explained that 'Sanji's heart burns hotter than his flames.'
