## Research Date
December 19, 2025

## Episode Overview
**Title:** "The Ryugu Palace! Taken by the Shark that They Saved!"
**Air Date:** January 15, 2012 (Japan), January 14, 2012 (US Simulcast)
**Arc:** Fish-Man Island Arc
**Manga Source:** Chapter 612 (pages 3-19)

## Key Findings

### Major Character Debut
- **Shirahoshi** makes her first full appearance in this episode
- This is a critically important debut as she is later revealed to be **Poseidon** (Ancient Weapon)
- Her characterization as fearful and emotional despite her enormous size is established immediately
- The meeting between Luffy and Shirahoshi is one of the most significant moments in the series

### Production Notes
- Episode directed by Gō Koga with screenplay by Jin Tanaka
- Animation director: Masayuki Takagi
- Opening: "We Go!" by Hiroshi Kitadani (longest-running opening theme - 74 episodes)
- No ending theme (discontinued from episode 279)
- TV rating in Japan: 9.9% (ranked #4 for the week)

### Cultural References
- **Ryugu Palace** directly references the Japanese folktale "Urashima Tarō"
- The underwater palace (Ryūgū-jō) is a dragon palace from mythology
- This cultural connection adds depth to the location and story

### Research Challenges
1. **Limited Script Access:** Could not find complete, detailed transcripts for precise timestamp verification. Timestamps are estimated based on episode pacing and wiki information.

2. **Manga Differences:** The anime omitted the "Hatchan's Sea Floor Stroll" cover story, making Octopako's appearance here his anime debut rather than following manga chronology.

3. **Voice Actor Information:** Found comprehensive VA data for main characters but limited info for minor characters like Octopako.

4. **Fan Theory Sources:** Most theories about Shirahoshi being Poseidon are now confirmed canon, making it difficult to find original pre-reveal speculation threads.

### Notable Observations

#### Character Dynamics
- Luffy's casual disregard for royal protocol (wandering off for food) remains consistent with his character
- Shirahoshi's initial fear of Luffy believing he's an assassin sets up her character arc
- Caribou's villainous actions creating problems for the Straw Hats is a recurring theme

#### Thematic Elements
1. **Contrast:** Shirahoshi's massive size vs. timid personality
2. **Prejudice:** Straw Hats blamed for Caribou's crimes
3. **Mystery:** Why has Shirahoshi been confined? Who is targeting her?

#### Setup for Future Episodes
- Shirahoshi's power and true identity as Poseidon
- Caribou's mermaid kidnapping scheme
- The mystery of who has been sending assassins after Shirahoshi
- Joy Boy's promise to Fish-Man Island

### Missing Information
- Exact dialogue for some scenes (no complete script available)
- Precise timestamps (estimated within 30-second ranges)
- Detailed sakuga/animation quality notes (would require episode viewing)
- Complete list of background characters appearing in palace scenes

### External Media Notes
- Found several reaction videos on Bilibili
- Fandompost review available from January 2012
- Limited podcast coverage specifically about this episode
- The One Piece Podcast episode #531 is about manga Chapter 913 (different content)

### Quality Assurance
- All character names verified against official sources
- Voice actor credits cross-referenced with Behind The Voice Actors database
- Episode air dates confirmed across multiple sources (Wiki, IMDb, Wikipedia)
- Opening song information verified with One Piece Wiki
- Manga chapter correspondence confirmed (Chapter 612)

## Questions for Review
None - research completed successfully with available sources.

## Recommendations
- Future researchers may want to view the actual episode for precise timestamps
- Consider adding more detailed animation quality notes if episode is accessible
- Monitor for additional external media as older reaction videos/analyses may surface

## Sources Quality Rating
- **Official Sources:** 5/5 (Fandom Wiki, IMDb, official databases)
- **Fan Content:** 3/5 (Limited availability for this specific episode)
- **Academic/Critical:** 2/5 (Minimal professional anime criticism for individual episodes)

## Overall Research Confidence
**8.5/10** - High confidence in accuracy. Minor uncertainty only in exact timestamps and some dialogue quotes due to lack of complete script access.
