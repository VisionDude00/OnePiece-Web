    "summary": "A widely discussed debate about whether rubber would truly provide complete immunity to lightning attacks of the magnitude Enel produces, with fans arguing it's an 'Acceptable Break from Reality' for narrative purposes.",
    "fullText": "Many fans have debated the scientific accuracy of Luffy's complete immunity to Enel's lightning. Real lightning and high voltage electricity would typically burn or melt rubber. However, fans generally agree this is a deliberate narrative choice by Oda to give Luffy a way to defeat a Logia user before the introduction of Haki. The concept of 'natural enemies' between Devil Fruits becomes a recurring theme. As one fan noted, 'Luffy's rubber is a magical rubber that has perfect insulating properties' - it's not meant to follow real-world physics.",

    "summary": "The revelation that rubber nullifies electricity introduced the concept of Devil Fruit 'natural enemies,' which fans theorize will be important for future battles and power dynamics throughout the series.",
    "fullText": "The introduction of the 'natural enemy' concept in the Luffy vs Enel fight established that certain Devil Fruit abilities can have inherent advantages or disadvantages against others, regardless of power level. Fans theorize this concept will continue to play crucial roles in future battles, potentially explaining how weaker characters might defeat stronger ones through strategic matchups. This also raised questions about other potential natural enemy combinations that might exist in the One Piece world.",

    "fullText": "Many fans believe that at the time of the Skypiea arc, Oda had not yet fully developed the Haki system that would later become the standard method for dealing with Logia users. The natural immunity of rubber to electricity provided a clever narrative solution that allowed Luffy to fight and defeat Enel without requiring Haki. This demonstrates Oda's long-term planning and ability to create logical power dynamics even before all systems were in place.",
