---

## Research Process Notes

### Sources Used
- Primary source: One Piece Wiki (Fandom) for episode details, air dates, production credits
- Behind The Voice Actors database for voice actor information
- Multiple web searches for episode reviews, reactions, and analysis
- Chapter 565 wiki page for manga comparison

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Script Availability**: Could not locate a full episode script or transcript for Episode 474. The episode transcription databases I found (Forever Dreaming, Anime Transcripts Wiki) did not have this specific episode available. Had to rely on wiki summaries and chapter information instead.

2. **Timestamp Accuracy**: Without access to the actual episode or a detailed transcript, timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions. These should be verified against the actual episode if possible.

3. **Voice Actor Timing**: Note that Daisuke Gori (original Japanese voice of Jinbe) passed away in 2010, the same year this episode aired. He was replaced by Katsuhisa Hoki starting from episode 440. Need to verify which voice actor was actually in Episode 474 specifically (sources indicate it was still Daisuke Gori, but this should be confirmed).

### Key Observations

1. **High-Impact Episode**: Episode 474 is one of the most iconic episodes of the Marineford Arc, featuring:
   - Luffy's confrontation with all three admirals simultaneously
   - Debut of Gomu Gomu no Stamp Gatling
   - Akainu's devastating Meteor Volcano attack
   - Little Oars Jr.'s dramatic revival
   - Execution order for Ace

2. **TV Ratings**: Achieved 10.5% rating in Japan (Rank #1 in time slot), indicating peak viewer engagement during the Marineford Arc.

3. **No Character/Location Debuts**: This episode does not introduce any new characters or locations. It focuses entirely on the escalation of the ongoing battle at Marineford.

4. **Technique Debut**: Gomu Gomu no Stamp Gatling is the only new technique that debuts in this episode (both manga Chapter 565 and anime Episode 474).

### Manga vs Anime Differences

1. **Dialogue Changes**: In the manga, Capone Bege commented on the ridiculousness of thinking Whitebeard sold out his allies. In the anime, this line was given to Trafalgar Law.

2. **Expanded Scenes**: The anime added more detailed scenes of the Pacifistas surrounding and attacking the pirates.

3. **Character Action Redistribution**: Some actions by named Whitebeard commanders in the manga were given to generic crew members in the anime.

### External Media Findings

**Reaction Videos**: Found several reaction videos on Dailymotion, Bilibili, and Patreon, but YouTube-specific results were limited. This episode is very popular for reactions due to the Luffy vs Admirals scene.

**Podcasts**: Found several One Piece podcasts that cover the Marineford Arc, though most discuss episode ranges rather than individual episodes.

**Articles/Reviews**: Found blog reviews and arc-wide reviews, but few dedicated solely to Episode 474.

**Fan Theories**: No specific fan theories found that originated from or focus on Episode 474 specifically. The episode is more about action and execution than mystery or lore reveals.

### Data Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive event coverage (10 major events identified)
- Accurate voice actor information from reliable sources
- Good variety of external media (videos, podcasts, articles)
- Clear thematic analysis

**Limitations:**
- Timestamps are estimated, not verified against actual episode
- No full script available for quote verification
- Limited specific fan theories for this episode
- Some voice actor details need verification (Jinbe's VA transition)

### Recommendations for Future Research

1. Verify all timestamps by watching the actual episode
2. Confirm exact voice actor for Jinbe in Episode 474
3. Search for more YouTube-specific content (direct platform search might yield better results)
4. Look for Reddit discussion threads from 2010 when the episode aired
5. Check for any official Toei Animation production notes or interviews about this episode
