    "summary": "A theory that the three original Marine Admirals (Akainu, Kizaru, and Kuzan/Aokiji) are not truly evil and may eventually turn against the World Government, with their fight for Fleet Admiral position being an elaborate ruse.",
    "fullText": "Recent revelations in the series have given rise to a theory that Akainu, Kizaru, and Kuzan might not be evil at all and would eventually fight the World Government. During the Q&A of One Piece SBS Volume 110, Oda hinted that it was Kizaru who helped Luffy with food during the battle at Egghead. This twist has prompted a new theory which states that the Admirals were never evil to begin with and are just doing what's right for the One Piece world. Some fans even theorize that the fight between Kuzan and Akainu for the Fleet Admiral position was an elaborate ruse. This theory retroactively applies to Episode 458's introduction of the three admirals, suggesting their assembly at Marineford may have had deeper motivations than simple obedience to the World Government.",

    "summary": "The deliberate choice to keep Akainu mysterious in Episode 458, without any flashback sequences unlike the other admirals, foreshadows his role as the most extreme and dangerous figure at Marineford.",
    "fullText": "In Episode 458, while Aokiji and Kizaru receive extensive flashback sequences showing their previous encounters with the Straw Hats, Akainu is deliberately kept mysterious with no flashbacks. This creative choice by the anime staff was intentional to build anticipation and emphasize Akainu's status as an unknown quantity - someone embodying 'Absolute Justice' whose extreme methods would shock viewers. The episode shows him simply standing before Sengoku, all business and focused on the mission. This presentation technique foreshadowed that Akainu would be the most pivotal and dangerous admiral during the Marineford War, ultimately being responsible for one of the arc's most tragic moments.",
