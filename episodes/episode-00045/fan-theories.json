    "theoryTitle": "Luffy's Bounty Will Eventually Reach 5.6 Billion (Go-Mu)",
    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Luffy's final bounty will be 5,600,000,000 berries, which creates a wordplay with 'Go-Mu' (5-6), referencing his Gomu Gomu no Mi Devil Fruit. This would surpass even Gold Roger's bounty and symbolize Luffy's achievement of surpassing the previous Pirate King. The theory suggests that Luffy's bounty progression, starting from this first 30 million berry bounty in Episode 45, is building toward this symbolic peak.",

    "theoryText": "The introduction of Loguetown as 'the town of the beginning and the end' in Episode 45 has led fans to theorize that Luffy's journey will come full circle, potentially ending where Roger's ended. Some theorize that Luffy might return to Loguetown for a significant event near the series' conclusion, mirroring how Roger's journey ended there. The symbolic nature of the location - where one era ended and another began - suggests it might play a role in the transition to whatever comes after Luffy achieves his dream.",

    "theoryText": "Fans have noted that Luffy's first bounty of 30 million berries is exceptionally high for a rookie pirate from the East Blue. Some theorize this wasn't just because of his victories over Buggy, Krieg, and Arlong, but because the World Government already recognized him as potentially more dangerous due to his connection to Shanks (a Yonko) and his Devil Fruit (the Gomu Gomu no Mi, later revealed to be the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika). The theory suggests the Marines may have had intelligence about Luffy's background that made them assign an unusually high first bounty.",

This has led fans to theorize that Shanks frequently talks about Luffy to other powerful figures, suggesting that Shanks has been keeping tabs on Luffy and considers him extremely important. Some theorize this indicates Shanks knew Luffy was special even before he gave him the straw hat, possibly due to knowledge about Luffy's Devil Fruit or destiny.",
