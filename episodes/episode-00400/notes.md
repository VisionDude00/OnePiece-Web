- **Roger:** Face fully revealed, personality and abilities explained
- **Brook:** Unique perspective as someone who knew Roger's era

### 5. External Media Search
**Challenges:**
- Limited podcast content specifically about Episode 400
- Most YouTube reaction content doesn't have easily searchable metadata
- Found several articles and blog posts analyzing the episode
- BiliBili reaction video found
- Multiple theory articles about Voice of All Things

**Media Found:**
- 1 reaction video (BiliBili)
- 1 blog post (Never Watched One Piece - Tumblr)
- 5 analytical articles (GameRant, ScreenRant)
- 1 video clip (Dailymotion)

### 6. Fan Theories
Developed 6 major fan theories based on Episode 400 revelations:
1. Robin's character growth through refusal
2. Luffy possessing Voice of All Things like Roger
3. Roger intentionally creating Great Pirate Era
4. Voice of All Things connected to Will of D
5. Shanks visiting Rayleigh to discuss Luffy
6. Different conclusions theory - truth may evolve

### 7. Data Structure Notes
- Created incremental character data (only Episode 400 appearances)
- Focused on debuts and revelations specific to this episode
- Did not attempt to build complete character profiles
- Cross-referenced previous episodes where relevant (callbacks)

## Important Findings

### Cultural Significance
This is arguably one of the most important expository episodes in One Piece:
- Rewrites official history (Roger's capture)
- Confirms existence of complete Void Century knowledge
- Establishes Roger's personality and abilities
- Connects past (Roger era) to present (Luffy's journey)
- Parallels between Roger and Luffy explicitly drawn

### IMDb Rating
Episode has exceptional 9.4/10 rating on IMDb, reflecting its importance to fans and the story.

### Animation Quality
Marked as STANDARD - this is primarily a dialogue/exposition episode rather than action-focused, though Kizaru's arrival scene has dramatic animation.

## Blockers and Questions

### Minor Blockers:
1. **No Direct Episode Script Access** - Relied on wiki summaries and manga chapters rather than episode transcript
2. **Limited YouTube Content** - Could not find many YouTube analysis videos with accessible metadata
3. **Exact Timestamp Uncertainty** - Without watching the episode directly, timestamps are estimates
4. **Voice Actor Clarification** - Initially found conflicting information about Rayleigh's Japanese VA, confirmed as Keiichi Sonobe (not Kōichi Yamadera)

### Questions for Review:
1. Should I include more specific dialogue quotes? (Limited by not having full script)
2. Are timestamp estimates acceptable or should they be marked as approximate?
3. Should I include more background characters (Duval, Peterman, Kid, Law) who appear briefly?

## Final Thoughts

Episode 400 is a landmark episode that fundamentally expands the One Piece lore. The revelations about Roger, Rayleigh, and the Void Century are some of the most significant in the entire series up to this point.

The episode balances major world-building revelations with character development moments (Robin's refusal, Luffy's declaration), making it both plot-essential and character-defining.

The decision to make this the 400th episode was clearly intentional - it's a celebration of how far the series has come while setting up mysteries that will take hundreds more episodes to resolve.

**Research Quality:** High confidence in accuracy despite not watching the episode directly, due to extensive cross-referencing of multiple sources and manga chapters.

**Spoiler Sensitivity:** This episode contains CRITICAL spoilers about Roger and the One Piece world's history. Marked appropriately throughout.
