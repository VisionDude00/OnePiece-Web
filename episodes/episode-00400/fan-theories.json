    "theoryText": "Robin's decision to refuse Rayleigh's offer to reveal the truth about the Void Century is not just about wanting to discover it herself - it's a profound demonstration of her character growth since Enies Lobby. After spending her entire life running and being used by others for her ability to read Poneglyphs, Robin finally has people she can trust and a journey worth taking. By refusing the shortcut to knowledge, she's choosing the journey with her friends over her lifelong goal, showing that the Straw Hats have become more important to her than the destination.",

Rayleigh's revelation that Roger 'loved flashy things' and enjoyed his Pirate King title despite knowing he would die suggests Roger was orchestrating events. By inspiring a new generation of pirates to seek One Piece, Roger ensured that someone would eventually complete what his crew was 'too early' to accomplish. His execution was the ultimate investment in the future.",

Roger had it, Luffy appears to have it, and this ability allowed them to understand the ancient history and Poneglyphs in a way that even brilliant scholars couldn't. This suggests the Will of D carriers have an inherent connection to the ancient civilization, possibly making them the 'chosen' ones who can hear the truth that was silenced 800 years ago.",
