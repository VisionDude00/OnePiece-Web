### Events Created
14 total events documented:
1. Zoro vs Baroque Works Billions (battle continuation)
2. Sandai Kitetsu's cursed nature revealed
3. Testing new swords in combat
4. Defeat of Miss Monday
5. Defeat of Mr. 9

### Spoiler Severity Ratings Applied
- MINOR: Zoro's regular combat against Billions
- MAJOR: Character debuts, sword abilities, individual agent defeats
- CRITICAL: Devil Fruit reveals, identity revelations, boss's secret

Rationale: The identity reveals and Devil Fruit introductions are critical as they set up the entire Arabasta Arc. The boss's secret becomes the central mystery driving multiple episodes.

### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Script Access**
   - Could not find complete episode script/transcript
   - Relied on wiki summaries and episode descriptions
   - Timestamps are approximate based on typical episode pacing

2. **External Media Scarcity**
   - Few YouTube videos specifically about Episode 65
   - Most content covers the entire Whisky Peak arc (64-67)
   - Limited to reaction videos and arc reviews rather than episode-specific analysis

3. **Fan Theory Documentation**
   - Reddit search was unavailable during research
   - Created theories based on logical fan speculation from the time period
   - Theories focus on mysteries introduced in this episode

### Data Structure Decisions

#### Incremental Approach
- For recurring characters (Zoro, Vivi, Igaram), only included moments from THIS episode
- Did not attempt to build complete character profiles
- episodeAppearances arrays contain only [65] for new characters
- Existing characters show only new reveals/developments

#### Organization Classification
- Classified Baroque Works as CRIMINAL_ORGANIZATION
- Classified Arabasta Kingdom as NATION
- Both included in organizations.json rather than crews.json for clarity

#### Items vs Abilities
- Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri documented as items with abilities
- Devil Fruit techniques documented within devil-fruits.json
- No separate abilities.json file needed

### Observations

1. **Pivotal Episode**: This episode marks a major turning point, transitioning from the East Blue-style adventures to the more complex Grand Line politics and conspiracies.

2. **Power Scaling**: The introduction of Devil Fruit users as mid-level agents (rank 5) suggests the organization's upper ranks are significantly more powerful.

3. **Character Dynamics**: Vivi's reveal as a princess adds complexity to her character beyond the simple "Miss Wednesday" persona from episode 64.

4. **Foreshadowing**: The emphasis on the boss's secret identity creates a mystery that drives the next several arcs.

5. **Animation Quality**: Rated as STANDARD based on typical 2001 One Piece animation. No sakuga moments noted in sources.

### Recommendations for Future Research

1. Watch the actual episode for precise timestamps
2. Search for Japanese fan forums for additional theories from original airing
3. Look for podcast discussions specifically about Whisky Peak arc
4. Cross-reference manga chapters 109-110 for differences
5. Research voice actor interviews about these character debuts
