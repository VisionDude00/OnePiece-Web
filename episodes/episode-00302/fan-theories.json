    "title": "Gear Second Actually Shortens Luffy's Lifespan",
    "description": "One of the most enduring fan theories is that Luffy's use of Gear Second significantly shortens his lifespan. This theory stems directly from Rob Lucci's analysis in this episode, where he explains that pumping blood through the heart at such an accelerated rate could destroy Luffy's circulatory system. Fans calculate that between Gear Second usage, Ivankov's hormone treatments at Impel Down (estimated at 10 years), and other life-draining techniques, Luffy may have already lost 20-30 years of his life. However, some fans counter that post-timeskip training with Rayleigh allowed Luffy to master Gear Second, reducing or eliminating the lifespan cost.",
