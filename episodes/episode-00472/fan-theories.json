    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Akainu's manipulation of Squard was part of a larger psychological warfare campaign orchestrated by Fleet Admiral Sengoku. The theory suggests that the Marines had been gathering intelligence on the allied captains' backstories and psychological vulnerabilities long before the war began, specifically to exploit them during the battle.",

    "theory": "Fans have theorized that Whitebeard's statement 'It's ridiculous to pin the blame on a child for the sins of a father' is thematic foreshadowing for later revelations about inherited will and the sins of the World Government being separate from the current generation. This philosophy directly contradicts the World Government's approach to bloodlines and inherited guilt.",

    "theory": "Some fans have speculated about the circumstances of Roger's destruction of Squard's crew. The theory suggests this may have been during Roger's final journey to Laugh Tale, and that Squard's crew might have been protecting something Roger needed or trying to stop him. This would explain why Roger, who is generally portrayed heroically, committed such a brutal act.",
