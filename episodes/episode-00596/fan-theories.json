The connection between Caesar's gas experiments and later artificial fruit development suggests Oda was planting seeds for future arcs.",

    "theory": "Fans have theorized that Caesar's unethical experiments with Smiley and the kidnapped children serve as a dark mirror to Vegapunk's scientific approach, highlighting the difference between science used for progress versus science used for weapons.

    "theory": "Some theorists suggested that Caesar's ability to give a Devil Fruit to poison gas (an inanimate substance) using Vegapunk's technique might be connected to how ancient weapons were created or how objects can 'eat' Devil Fruits.
