## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Timestamp Estimation
Since I couldn't watch the actual episode, timestamps are estimated based on typical One Piece episode pacing:
- Opening: ~00:00-02:30
- First act: ~03:00-08:00
- Second act: ~08:00-16:00
- Third act: ~16:00-22:00
- Preview: ~22:30-23:00

These timestamps should be verified against the actual episode when possible.

### 2. Limited Script Access
Could not find a complete episode script or transcript. Had to rely on:
- Wiki summaries
- Manga chapter comparison
- Episode descriptions from multiple sources

### 3. External Media Gaps
- Could not find specific YouTube analysis videos for Episode 596
- Most video content covers the Punk Hazard arc broadly rather than this specific episode
- Reddit discussion threads for this specific episode were not found in search results
- Podcast coverage is arc-wide rather than episode-specific

### 4. Voice Actor Information
English voice actors for minor characters (Monet, Kin'emon in this episode) were not readily available and were omitted from the credits section.

## Notable Observations

### Animation Quality
Episode was noted as "STANDARD" quality - typical for mid-arc episodes during this period of One Piece production.

### Manga Differences
The anime extended several scenes:
1. Luffy vs Smoker/Tashigi fight scenes
2. Franky and Robin vs centaurs
3. Marine ship explosion sequence
4. Law and Chopper's laboratory movements

### Thematic Elements
This episode strongly emphasizes:
1. **Consequences of unethical science** - Smiley's attack kills Marines
2. **Direct action vs planning** - Luffy's approach vs Law's strategy
3. **Body/identity themes** - Continued body-swap complications

### Production Notes
- TV Rating: 8.7% (Rank 3)
- Eyecatcher character: Usopp
- No ending song (episodes 279-1070 had no endings)
- Opening: "Hands Up!" by Kota Shinzato (episodes 591-628)

## Summary

Episode 596 is a pivotal episode in the Punk Hazard arc where Caesar's deadly experiment Smiley begins its attack on the island, killing several Marines and threatening everyone present. Luffy declares his intention to capture Caesar and successfully grabs him by the episode's end, setting up the confrontation that drives the next several episodes. The episode balances action, comedy (body-swap scenes), and darker themes (unethical experimentation, casualties of war).

The research was comprehensive but limited by lack of access to the actual episode video and complete scripts. All information was cross-referenced across multiple sources for accuracy.
