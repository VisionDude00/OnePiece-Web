    "summary": "The revelation that Lassoo, an inanimate object, consumed a Devil Fruit through special technology is an early hint at Vegapunk's scientific capabilities that would become more important later in the series.",
    "fullText": "Episode 113 introduces Lassoo, the first inanimate object shown to have eaten a Devil Fruit. At the time, this was briefly mentioned as being possible through special technology, but fans theorized that this would be expanded upon later. This early mention of technology allowing objects to consume Devil Fruits was a subtle foreshadowing of Vegapunk's genius and the advanced science in the One Piece world. Many fans believe this was intentional setup for future arcs involving Vegapunk and the mechanics of Devil Fruits.",

    "fullText": "Episode 113 marks the beginning of what many fans consider one of Usopp's defining moments in the series. Facing overwhelming odds against Devil Fruit users who mock his friend's dreams, Usopp must overcome his natural cowardice. This battle (which continues in episodes 114-115) is often cited as a turning point for Usopp's character, demonstrating that he can be genuinely brave when it matters. Some fans theorize that Oda intentionally paired the two weakest Straw Hats (Usopp and Chopper) against formidable opponents to show that courage isn't about strength, but about standing up for what matters even when afraid.",
