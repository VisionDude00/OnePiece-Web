    "title": "Jinbe Was Holding Back Against Luffy",
    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that Jinbe was not fighting at full strength during his confrontation with Luffy in episode 549. The theory suggests that Jinbe, being a former Warlord of the Sea and significantly more experienced than post-timeskip Luffy at this point, was merely trying to knock sense into Luffy rather than actually defeat him. This is supported by Jinbe's reluctance to fight and his philosophical approach to the conflict, suggesting he was more interested in teaching Luffy about Fish-Man Island's complex social dynamics than winning a battle.",

    "theoryText": "The revelation of Brook's soul separation ability in episode 549 is theorized to be deliberate foreshadowing by Oda for Brook's crucial role in the Whole Cake Island/Totto Land arc against Big Mom, whose powers also involve soul manipulation. Fans suggest that Oda was setting up Brook as the perfect counter to Big Mom's Soul-Soul Fruit (Soru Soru no Mi) by establishing his mastery over his own soul through the Yomi Yomi no Mi. This would make Brook uniquely resistant to Big Mom's soul-stealing abilities.",

    "theoryText": "The ongoing tension in episode 549 between Luffy's desire to help and Jinbe's concerns about human involvement is seen by some fans as foreshadowing for the prophecy that Luffy will destroy Fish-Man Island. The theory suggests that Luffy's well-intentioned actions, despite trying to help, may ultimately lead to Fish-Man Island's destruction - but in a way that benefits the fish-men by forcing them to move to the surface and integrate with humanity, thus breaking the cycle of hatred that Jinbe is so concerned about in this episode.",

    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized about the mechanics of Robin's Cuerpo Fleur technique introduced in episode 549, specifically whether damage to the clone affects Robin's real body. Based on how her other Hana Hana abilities work (where damage to sprouted body parts hurts Robin), many theorize that Cuerpo Fleur clones also share damage with the original, making it a risky technique despite its tactical advantages. This would explain why Robin uses it sparingly and primarily for non-combat purposes like stopping fights rather than engaging in direct battle.",
