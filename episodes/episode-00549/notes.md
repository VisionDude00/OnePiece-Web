## Research Process Summary

### Step 1: Script Search
**Status:** Limited Success
**Findings:**
- Full episode scripts/transcripts are not publicly available for copyrighted anime content
- No official transcript sources found
- Relied on episode summaries from One Piece Wiki and other sources
- Used detailed plot descriptions from multiple sources to reconstruct events

**Sources Checked:**
- Forever Dreaming Transcripts (incomplete coverage)
- Transcribed Anime Scripts Tumblr (only episodes 1-2, 147 available)
- Anime Transcripts Wiki (checked but episode 549 not transcribed)
- Crunchyroll official (no transcript feature)

**Blocker:** Complete dialogue scripts are not available. Reconstructed events and quotes from wiki summaries and reviews.

### Step 2: Episode Viewing
**Status:** Not Completed (working from secondary sources)
**Approach:** Used comprehensive wiki summaries, reviews, and fan discussions to identify key events
**Note:** Timestamps are approximate estimates based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions

### Step 3: Event Annotation
**Status:** Completed
**Events Identified:** 7 major events
1. Luffy vs Jinbe duel begins (BATTLE_START - MAJOR)
2. Fish-Man Karate explanation (POWER_REVEAL - MAJOR)
3. Robin's Cuerpo Fleur debut (TECHNIQUE_DEBUT - MAJOR)
4. Brook's soul separation reveal (POWER_REVEAL - MAJOR)
5. Straw Hats plan escape (MAJOR_DECISION - MINOR)
6. Hody moves forces to Gyoncorde Plaza (LOCATION_DEPARTURE - MINOR)
7. Luffy and Jinbe's fight interrupted (BATTLE_END - MINOR)

**Key Themes:**
- Racial prejudice and cycles of hatred
- Post-timeskip power demonstrations

- 3 written reviews/articles
- 1 podcast (note: podcast episode 549 does NOT correspond to anime episode 549)

- Most available content is arc-level reviews rather than episode-specific

### Step 6: Fan Theories

2. Brook's soul powers foreshadow Big Mom arc (CONFIRMED - verified by later episodes)
3. Luffy will destroy Fish-Man Island prophecy (UNCONFIRMED - ongoing)
4. Robin's Cuerpo Fleur shares damage (PLAUSIBLE - based on fruit mechanics)

**Sources:**

- CBR theory articles
- Reddit discussions (limited specific results)

### Workarounds Applied:
- Used comprehensive wiki summaries for event details
- Cross-referenced multiple sources for accuracy
- Relied on manga chapter information for event sequence
