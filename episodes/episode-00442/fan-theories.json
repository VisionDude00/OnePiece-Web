    "summary": "The most popular theory is that Crocodile was assigned female at birth (AFAB) and Ivankov used his Horm-Horm Fruit powers to change Crocodile's sex, which is the 'precious weakness' Ivankov references.",
    "fullText": "During the Impel Down arc in Episode 442, Ivankov reveals he knows a 'precious weakness' of Crocodile's from when Crocodile was a rookie pirate. The most prevalent fan theory suggests that Crocodile was born female and Ivankov used the Horm-Horm Fruit to transform Crocodile into a male. This would explain why Crocodile is embarrassed when seeing Ivankov and why Ivankov can use this as blackmail. Supporting evidence includes: 1) The Horm-Horm Fruit's established ability to change a person's sex, 2) Oda deliberately obscuring details of Crocodile's appearance as a youth in flashbacks, 3) Crocodile's strong negative reaction to Ivankov's presence, 4) Ivankov's specific phrasing about 'fixing' Crocodile if he misbehaves. Alternative theories suggest Crocodile might have been a slave who escaped from Celestial Dragons, or has some other shameful past that Ivankov witnessed.",

    "summary": "An alternative theory suggests that Crocodile's secret is that he was once a slave of the Celestial Dragons, similar to other Revolutionary Army founding members.",
    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that Crocodile's 'precious weakness' that Ivankov knows about is related to being a former slave of the Celestial Dragons. This would connect Crocodile to the Revolutionary Army's origins, as many founding members were escaped slaves. The shame of having been enslaved would be something Crocodile would desperately want to keep secret, especially given his pride and ambition. Ivankov, being part of the Revolutionary Army, would have known about this if Crocodile was among those who escaped. This theory is less popular than the gender-change theory but provides an alternative explanation for their mysterious connection.",
