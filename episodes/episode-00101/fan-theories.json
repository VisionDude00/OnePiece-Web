    "theory": "This theory proposes that Ace never truly died at Marineford. According to this theory, while Ace's heart stopped for a few minutes at Marineford, his brain wasn't damaged. The theorist suggests that the current user of the Toki Toki no Mi (Time-Time Fruit) sent Ace to the future at the request of Shanks, possibly with Dragon's involvement. The theory addresses the evidence of Ace's Vivre Card burning away completely by questioning whether all of it actually burned - suggesting a piece might have been left. It proposes that a Vivre Card burns completely when the heart stops, but the person could still have brain activity and not be clinically dead. The damaged internal organs and skin were allegedly regenerated by Marco after Shanks retrieved his body, potentially taking days, weeks, or months.",

    "title": "Would Ace Have Survived Without the Vivre Card?",
    "theory": "This theory explores the counterfactual scenario of what would have happened if Ace never gave Luffy his Vivre Card in Episode 101. The central question is whether Ace would still be alive if this exchange had never occurred. The theory suggests that without the Vivre Card, Luffy would not have been able to track Ace's location or know about his deteriorating condition when he was imprisoned. This means Luffy might not have attempted the Impel Down rescue mission, potentially changing the entire chain of events leading to Marineford. However, the counterargument is that even without Luffy's involvement, the Summit War would still have occurred, and Ace's fate might have been the same or potentially worse without Luffy's rescue attempt. Some theorists argue that the Vivre Card actually sealed Ace's fate by drawing Luffy into a situation that ultimately contributed to Ace's decision to sacrifice himself.",

    "title": "The Vivre Card as Narrative Foreshadowing Device",
    "theory": "This analytical theory examines how the Vivre Card introduced in Episode 101 serves as a masterful narrative foreshadowing device by Oda. The theory notes that at the time of Episode 101, the Vivre Card seems like a simple navigation tool and a symbol of brotherly bonds. However, its true narrative purpose only becomes clear hundreds of episodes later during Impel Down and Marineford. The card's property of burning when the owner's life force weakens becomes a visual metaphor for Ace's deteriorating condition - creating dramatic tension as viewers watch it slowly disintegrate. The theory suggests that Oda deliberately introduced this mechanic in a relatively low-stakes filler episode context to establish the rules so that when it appears again in high-stakes situations, viewers understand the implications immediately. The complete burning of the card serves as a devastating visual confirmation of Ace's death that resonates more powerfully than dialogue alone could achieve.",

    "title": "Anime Filler Extended Ace's Presence for Emotional Impact",
    "theory": "This production theory suggests that the anime deliberately extended Ace's time with the Straw Hats through filler episodes (98, 99, 101, 102) to create stronger emotional bonds between Ace and both the crew and the audience. In the manga, Ace departs almost immediately after the Vivre Card exchange, but the anime gave viewers several episodes to see Ace interact with the crew in various situations. The theory proposes this was a calculated decision by the anime production team to amplify the emotional impact of Ace's eventual death at Marineford. By making Ace feel like more of a recurring character rather than a brief cameo, his loss would resonate more deeply with anime viewers. The Scorpion episode specifically showcases Ace's combat abilities, compassion, and heroic nature - all traits that make his eventual sacrifice more tragic. This theory suggests the filler content, while not canon to the manga, serves the narrative purpose of emotional investment.",

    "theory": "This lore-focused theory examines how the introduction of Vivre Cards in Episode 101, specifically noting they are 'made in the New World,' serves as early foreshadowing for the New World saga. At the time of the Arabasta arc, the New World is a mysterious, far-off concept that represents the ultimate challenge for pirates. By revealing that Vivre Cards originate from the New World, Oda introduces the idea that this region possesses advanced or unique technologies not found in Paradise (the first half of the Grand Line). The theory suggests this detail plants seeds for worldbuilding that pays off hundreds of episodes later when the crew actually reaches the New World. It also raises questions about how Ace obtained the materials or knowledge to create a Vivre Card while still in Paradise, implying his connections to the Whitebeard Pirates gave him access to New World resources. This small detail in a filler episode actually contributes to the larger worldbuilding of the One Piece universe.",
