    "theoryText": "When Akainu states he was 'frightened' when Bonney escaped from the World Government, it suggests she has knowledge of or connection to major secrets. Many fans theorized she could be related to important figures in the World Government, potentially connected to the Celestial Dragons, or knows secrets about the Void Century. Her ability to alter ages also sparked theories about her potentially being involved in life-extension experiments or having knowledge of immortality operations.",

    "theoryText": "Drake's deliberate provocation of Kaido's forces led some fans to theorize he had ulterior motives beyond simple piracy. Some speculated he might be working for someone else or trying to infiltrate Kaido's organization from the inside. His calculated approach and the question 'Will this get Kaido's attention?' seemed too strategic for a simple rookie pirate challenge.",

    "theoryText": "When the Blackbeard Pirates immediately fled from Admiral Akainu despite Blackbeard having two Devil Fruits, fans theorized about the limitations of his new powers. Some suggested he hadn't fully mastered Whitebeard's Gura Gura no Mi yet, while others theorized that having two Devil Fruits came with drawbacks or instability that made him vulnerable. This fueled discussions about whether Blackbeard's unique body could truly handle multiple fruits without consequences.",
