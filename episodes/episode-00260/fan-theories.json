    "title": "Franky's Back Weakness is Intentional Character Design",
    "theory": "Franky's vulnerable back serves as more than just a combat weakness - it represents his inability to reach his own back, symbolizing the need for crew mates and allies. This parallels the broader Water 7 theme that no one can succeed alone, and foreshadows Franky eventually joining a crew where others can protect his back.",

Without this moment showing Robin that her sacrifice was understood but rejected, she wouldn't have found the courage to accept rescue.",
