    "summary": "A theory that Conqueror's Haki is genetically passed down through lineages, particularly the Will of D, explaining why Luffy, Roger, Ace, and Garp all possess this rare ability.",
    "fullText": "The manifestation of Luffy's Conqueror's Haki at Marineford supports the theory that this rare power is inherited through bloodlines, especially those bearing the initial 'D'. Vice Admiral Doberman's comment that Luffy's possession of Conqueror's Haki makes sense because he is Dragon's son reinforces this connection. The fact that Garp, Dragon, and Luffy all have connections to this power, along with Roger and Ace, suggests a genetic component tied to the mysterious Will of D.",

    "fullText": "When Luffy unconsciously used Conqueror's Haki to stop Ace's execution, it created parallels to Gol D. Roger's own mastery of this power. Some fans theorize that Shanks recognized this same power in young Luffy in Chapter 1, which is why he entrusted him with his straw hat - the same hat Roger once wore. The fact that Luffy manifested this power in a desperate moment to save his brother, just as Roger would have done for his crew, suggests Luffy carries Roger's will forward.",

    "fullText": "Episode 479 ends with Garp blocking Luffy's path to Ace, declaring that Luffy must defeat him to pass. Fans theorize that Garp's conflicted emotions led him to take this position knowing that Luffy's determination would allow him to land a blow, giving Garp a 'legitimate' reason to step aside without betraying his Marine vows. His statement 'over my dead body' could be interpreted as Garp giving Luffy permission to do what's necessary. This theory is supported by Garp's earlier comment that he suspected Luffy was born with Conqueror's Haki, showing his awareness of Luffy's potential.",
