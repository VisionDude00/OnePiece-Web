### Key Findings

#### Episode Content
This episode is a critical moment in the Marineford War, serving as a bridge between Luffy's unconscious display of Conqueror's Haki (Episode 478) and his confrontation with Garp (continues into Episode 480). The episode focuses on:

1. Characters reacting to Luffy's Haki manifestation
2. Whitebeard's strategic decision to support Luffy
3. Inazuma's crucial intervention with the Choki Choki no Mi
4. The climactic moment when Garp blocks Luffy's path

#### Character Debuts/Key Moments
- **Inazuma:** First major battlefield appearance at Marineford, demonstrating Choki Choki no Mi abilities
- **Luffy:** Recognition of his Conqueror's Haki by multiple characters
- **Garp:** Emotional peak of his internal conflict, forced to block his own grandson

#### Devil Fruit Information
- **Choki Choki no Mi debut:** This episode marks the first major tactical use of Inazuma's Devil Fruit powers in the series, showing creative terrain manipulation

### Production Details

#### Voice Acting
- **Kinryu Arimoto** (Whitebeard's Japanese voice actor) passed away on February 1, 2019 at age 78
- This episode featured strong performances given the emotional weight of the Garp-Luffy confrontation

#### Music
- **Opening:** "One day" by THE ROOTLESS (Episodes 459-492)
  - Written specifically for the somber tone of Marineford Arc
  - Over 20 rewrites to arrive at the message of "protecting the things that are important to me"
- **Ending:** None (endings were omitted from Episode 279 onwards until Episode 1071)

### Timestamp Challenges

**Note:** Specific precise timestamps were difficult to obtain through web research alone. The timestamps provided in the JSON files are estimated based on:
- Episode structure and pacing
- Sequence of events as described in summaries
- Typical One Piece episode timing patterns
- Cross-referencing multiple source descriptions

For a final production version, these timestamps should be verified by watching the actual episode.

### Research Limitations

1. **No Full Script Available:** Despite searching multiple transcript databases (Forever Dreaming, Anime Transcripts Wiki, Transcribed Anime Scripts), no complete line-by-line script for Episode 479 was found. Research relied on:
   - Episode summaries from wikis
   - Fan reviews and reactions
   - Manga chapter references

2. **Limited Direct Episode Discussion:** While the Marineford Arc has extensive discussion, specific Episode 479 threads on Reddit or other forums were not readily accessible through search results.

3. **Reaction Video Availability:** Most high-quality reaction videos found were on Bilibili rather than YouTube, possibly due to copyright restrictions or regional availability.

### Notable Observations

#### Episode Significance
Episode 479 is particularly significant because:
- It's the immediate aftermath of Luffy's first Conqueror's Haki display
- It shows the unified support of Whitebeard's forces behind Luffy
- It sets up one of the most emotionally devastating moments (Garp vs Luffy)
- It demonstrates creative Devil Fruit usage (Inazuma's bridge)

#### Fan Reception
Based on reviews and discussions found:
- Highly praised for emotional depth
- Garp's conflict is frequently cited as one of the most heartbreaking moments
- The episode is seen as crucial setup for the climax of the Marineford Arc
- Luffy's Haki moment (Episode 478-479) is considered one of the most iconic scenes in One Piece

#### Thematic Elements
Strong themes of:
- Family vs Duty (Garp's impossible position)
- Inherited Will (Luffy's Haki connecting to lineage)
- Sacrifice (Pirates clearing path for Luffy)
- Unity (Multiple forces working together)

### Fan Theories Identified

1. **Conqueror's Haki and the Will of D:** Theory that this power is genetically inherited through bloodlines, particularly those with the "D" initial
2. **Luffy-Roger Parallels:** Luffy's unconscious Haki mirrors Roger's power, suggesting spiritual succession
3. **Garp's Intentional Defeat:** Theory that Garp positioned himself to be defeated as a way to reconcile duty and family
4. **Admiral Threat Assessment:** Theory that Admirals prioritized Luffy's elimination after recognizing his potential
