    "theory": "Kuma didn't scatter the Straw Hats randomly at Sabaody - he deliberately sent each member to a location that would help them grow stronger during the timeskip. His knowledge of these islands came from his own journey searching for a cure for Sapphire Scale disease. Episode 507 reveals Kuma was a Revolutionary Army officer protecting Luffy, supporting the theory that he carefully planned each Straw Hat's destination.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Kuma separated the Straw Hats not just to protect them, but also because he was acting on Monkey D. Dragon's orders. Dragon, as Luffy's father and leader of the Revolutionary Army, wanted to ensure the Straw Hats would be strong enough to become future allies. The revelation in Episode 507 that Kuma was a Revolutionary Army officer supports this theory.",

    "theory": "When Episode 507 revealed Rayleigh's training offer, fans theorized that Rayleigh couldn't train Luffy for the full two years because it would make him too powerful too quickly, breaking the story's power scaling. This theory suggested Rayleigh would leave partway through training (confirmed in later episodes where Rayleigh trains Luffy for 1.5 years and leaves him alone for the final 6 months).",
