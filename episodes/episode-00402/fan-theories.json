    "theory": "The Pacifistas don't use artificial Devil Fruits to create their laser beams. Instead, they potentially use technology derived from Kizaru's awakened Light-Light Fruit abilities, with Vegapunk creating permanent light constructs or devices that can harness and replicate the Pika Pika no Mi's properties without requiring an actual Devil Fruit.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize a deeper connection between Admiral Kizaru and Dr. Vegapunk beyond just the laser technology. The theory suggests that Kizaru may have willingly worked closely with Vegapunk to perfect the Pacifista laser weapons, possibly as test subjects or through extensive study of his Devil Fruit abilities. This could explain why every Pacifista model uses laser weapons derived specifically from Kizaru's powers rather than other Devil Fruit abilities.",

    "title": "Pacifista Speed Inconsistency Theory",
    "theory": "Fans have debated whether Pacifista laser beams are truly light-speed like Kizaru's attacks. The theory notes that Pre-Timeskip Straw Hats could dodge Pacifista beams (as shown in episode 402), but Luffy doesn't have time to react to Kizaru's direct light-speed attacks in certain situations. This suggests either: (1) Pacifista lasers are slower imitations of true light-speed attacks, (2) Vegapunk couldn't perfectly replicate the speed aspect, or (3) Kizaru's personal attacks have additional properties beyond just light speed.",
