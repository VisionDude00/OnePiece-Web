    "theoryTitle": "The Klabautermann is a Physical Manifestation of a Ship's Soul",
    "theoryText": "The Klabautermann that Usopp saw on Skypiea (Episode 228) is the spirit of the Going Merry itself, brought to life by the crew's love and care for their ship. This theory suggests that ships can develop souls when they are truly loved by their crews, and the Klabautermann appears to protect and warn the crew when the ship is near destruction. Episode 232's revelation that the Merry is beyond repair gains deeper emotional significance when considering that the ship itself loved the crew enough to manifest a spirit to help them.",

    "theoryTitle": "The Going Merry's Keel Damage Represents the Crew's Emotional Breaking Point",
    "theoryText": "The irreparable keel damage revealed in Episode 232 symbolically represents the Straw Hat crew reaching their emotional and physical breaking point after all their adventures. Just as the keel is the foundation of a ship, the crew's bonds are the foundation of their success. The keel breaking mirrors how the crew is about to fracture with Usopp's departure. The theory suggests this was intentionally paralleled by Oda to show that sometimes what we love cannot be saved, no matter how much we want it to be.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Paulie was initially planned to be the shipwright who joined the Straw Hats instead of Franky. Evidence includes: his debut in Episode 232 as a skilled shipwright with a unique fighting style (rope techniques), his strong sense of justice, his financial struggles giving him a reason to leave Water 7, and his immediate rapport with the crew. However, Oda ultimately chose Franky because he was more unique and fit better with the crew's dynamic. This theory is supported by early fan expectations during the arc's original run.",

    "theoryText": "The theory posits that Rob Lucci, Kaku, and Kalifa were embedded in Galley-La Company for approximately five years before Episode 232, slowly gaining Iceburg's trust to eventually steal the Pluton blueprints. This long-term infiltration explains why Kaku is trusted enough to inspect the Going Merry in Episode 232 and why Kalifa serves as Iceburg's personal secretary. The theory highlights the World Government's patience and ruthlessness in pursuing ancient weapons.",

Some fans claim to have seen hints of this in later episodes, though it remains unconfirmed whether the Sunny has manifested a visible spirit like the Merry did.",
