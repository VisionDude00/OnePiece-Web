## Important Story Elements

### Little Oars Jr. and Ace's Friendship
The flashback revealing Ace's gift of the kasa is central to this episode's emotional impact. Key details:
- Ace learned to make kasa in **Wano Country** (early foreshadowing)
- Burned first two attempts due to Mera Mera no Mi powers
- Successfully created the giant kasa on third attempt
- The kasa provided protection from sun, rain, and snow
- This act of kindness motivated Little Oars Jr.'s entire charge at Marineford

### New Techniques Debuted
1. **Ursus Shock** (Bartholomew Kuma) - First seen at full power in large-scale warfare
2. **Tsuno-Tokage** (Gecko Moria) - Shadow Horn Spears technique

### Character Power Demonstrations
- **Bartholomew Kuma:** Massive Ursus Shock demonstrated devastating area-of-effect capabilities
- **Donquixote Doflamingo:** First clear demonstration of string cutting ability (severing ancient giant's leg)
- **Gecko Moria:** Shadow manipulation for impaling attacks
- **Boa Hancock:** Attacks both sides indiscriminately, maintaining independence

## Challenges and Uncertainties

### Timestamp Estimates
⚠️ **Note:** Exact timestamps for events are estimated based on typical episode structure and plot progression described in sources. Without access to the actual episode video, timestamps are approximate:
- Opening action: ~3:15
- Giant Squad battle: ~5:30
- Hancock entrance: ~8:45
- Ursus Shock: ~12:20
- Flashback: ~14:50
- Oars stands again: ~17:35
- Leg severing: ~19:10
- Final blow: ~20:45

These should be verified against the actual episode when possible.

### Missing Information

#### YouTube Content
Despite multiple search attempts, specific YouTube reaction videos and analysis videos for episode 464 were difficult to locate. Found references to:
- Skaampy's reaction (Patreon link)
- Streamable reaction video (episodes 462-464)
- TikTok content mentioning Little Oars Jr.

However, comprehensive YouTube analysis videos specifically for this episode were not found. This may be because:
1. Marineford content is often covered in arc-wide analyses rather than episode-by-episode
2. Copyright strikes may have removed older content
3. The episode is often grouped with surrounding episodes in reactions

#### Voice Actor Information
- Little Oars Jr.'s English voice actor is listed as "TBD" - could not confirm from available sources
- Some minor character voice actors may be incomplete

#### Fan Theories
Attempted searches for fan theories specifically about episode 464 yielded limited results. Found:
- General discussion about Doflamingo's string powers (theory that he creates thread puppets)
- Speculation about whether Moria would successfully turn Oars Jr. into a zombie
- Discussion about Little Oars Jr.'s survival status

However, no substantial episode-specific theories were documented. Most fan discussion focused on emotional reactions rather than theorizing.

## Notable Observations

### Thematic Significance
This episode powerfully demonstrates One Piece's central themes:
1. **Friendship and Loyalty:** Little Oars Jr. willing to die for Ace
2. **Kindness Repaid:** Simple act of making a hat inspires ultimate sacrifice
3. **Cost of War:** Brutal injuries and tragic deaths
4. **Determination:** Standing back up despite mortal wounds

### Wano Country Foreshadowing
The mention of Ace learning to make kasa in Wano Country (episodes 464, aired 2010) is an early reference to a location that wouldn't become central to the story until the Wano Arc (starting around episode 890, airing 2019). This represents nearly a decade of foreshadowing.

### Fan Reception
Overwhelmingly positive reception:
- Praised for animation quality
- Emotional impact highly noted
- Considered one of the best episodes of Marineford Arc
- 9.2/10 IMDb rating indicates strong viewer appreciation

### Manga Differences
The anime notably:
1. Extended the Giant Squad battle sequences
2. Expanded the flashback of Ace making the kasa
3. Enhanced animation for brutal moments (Ursus Shock, leg severing)
4. Maintained emotional beats while adding visual spectacle
