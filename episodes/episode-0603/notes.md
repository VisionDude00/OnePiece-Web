4. **Exact Timestamps:** Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode pacing and event descriptions, not from watching the actual episode.

## Notable Findings

1. **Pacing:** Episode 603 adapted nearly all of Chapter 677 (18 of 19 pages), which was relatively good pacing compared to later arcs.

2. **Parallel Storylines:** The episode cleverly parallels two alliance formations - Luffy-Law on Punk Hazard and Kid-Apoo-Hawkins elsewhere, emphasizing the theme of cooperation in the New World.

3. **Law's Planning:** This episode establishes Law as a master strategist who thinks multiple steps ahead, setting up his character role for future arcs.

4. **Body Swap Resolution:** The long-running body swap subplot (started in episode 586/587) is resolved, allowing Smoker and Tashigi to return to normal.

5. **Director Note:** Aya Komaki, who directed this episode, later became Series Director for episodes 892-961.

## Potential Issues/Blockers

1. **No Direct Script Source:** Could not locate an official or fan transcript. Future researchers may want to watch the episode directly for exact dialogue.

2. **Timestamp Accuracy:** All timestamps are estimates based on typical episode pacing. Should be verified against the actual episode.

3. **Limited YouTube Content:** Could not find specific YouTube reaction videos or analyses for this exact episode number. General Punk Hazard arc content exists but not episode-specific.

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. Watch the actual episode to verify timestamps and exact dialogue
2. Search YouTube directly (not through web search) for episode-specific content
3. Check Reddit's r/OnePiece for historical discussion threads about this episode
4. Look for Crunchyroll or Funimation episode comments for additional fan reactions

## Overall Assessment

Research for Episode 603 is **COMPLETE** with minor limitations. All required files have been created with comprehensive data. The main limitation is the lack of a full script and exact timestamps, but episode summaries and event descriptions are detailed and well-sourced.
