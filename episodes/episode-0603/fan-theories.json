    "summary": "Fans theorize that Law's ability to swap seastone chains during his stay at Caesar's lab demonstrates his exceptional strategic thinking and planning abilities, foreshadowing his role as a master tactician in future arcs.",
    "fullText": "Law's reveal that he had swapped seastone chains with normal ones while 'freeloading' at Caesar's laboratory shows incredible foresight and planning. This moment demonstrates that Law is always thinking several steps ahead, preparing escape routes and backup plans even when appearing to cooperate. Fans speculate this strategic mindset is what makes him such a valuable ally to Luffy and why his plans in future arcs are so intricate. The fake chains reveal suggests Law never truly trusted Caesar and was preparing for betrayal from the start.",

    "summary": "A debunked theory claimed Law could use his Ope Ope no Mi to trap Devil Fruit users with seastone. Fans have explained why this strategy wouldn't work due to seastone's properties affecting Law himself.",
    "fullText": "Some fans theorized that Law could use his Ope Ope no Mi abilities to strategically place seastone on opponents to weaken them during battle. However, this theory has been largely debunked by the community. The main flaws are: (1) If Law gets hold of seastone, he himself might feel the pressure of it, weakening his own Devil Fruit powers; (2) Law's Devil Fruit abilities probably won't work on or around seastone since the entire concept of seastone is based on negating Devil Fruit abilities. This means Law likely cannot get seastone inside his Room or switch it with his opponents. Episode 603 demonstrates Law's awareness of seastone's limitations by showing he had to swap the chains while not using his powers.",

    "fullText": "Episode 603 shows three Supernova captains meeting to form an alliance, mirroring the Luffy-Law alliance forming at the same time. This parallel suggests that the new generation of pirates is changing the power structure of the New World by working together instead of competing individually. Fans theorized this would lead to major confrontations with the Yonko, which proved correct as both alliances targeted emperors (Luffy-Law aimed for Kaido, while Kid's alliance also targeted a Yonko). The scene's placement in the same episode as Law's escape emphasizes the theme of strategic planning and alliance-building being crucial for survival in the New World.",
