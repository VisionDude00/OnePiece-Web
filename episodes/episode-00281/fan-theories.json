    },
    "theoryText": "The straw hat represents more than just a physical object passed from Roger to Shanks to Luffy. Every time Luffy places the hat on someone else's head (like when he gave it to Nami during her breakdown), he's symbolically sharing the 'inherited will' and promise that comes with it. The hat becomes a physical manifestation of the promise to protect and save that person. This is why Luffy is so careful about who touches it and when he gives it to others - it's a sacred contract of trust and protection.",

    },
    "theoryText": "The deliberate parallels between Nami's rescue from Arlong and Robin's rescue from CP9 aren't just callbacks - they show the evolution of the crew's bonds and their increasing willingness to sacrifice for each other. In Arlong Park, Nami needed to ask for help and the crew fought a regional threat. In Enies Lobby, the crew didn't wait to be asked and declared war on the entire World Government. Each rescue arc in One Piece follows this pattern, with the stakes and the crew's commitment growing stronger each time.",
