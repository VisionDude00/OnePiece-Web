# Research Notes for Episode 229

## Episode Overview
Episode 229, "The Dashing Sea Train and the City of Water: Water Seven!" marks a significant milestone as the first episode of the Water 7 Arc, one of the most beloved arcs in One Piece.

## Research Process

### Sources Consulted
- One Piece Wiki (Fandom) - Primary source for episode details, character information, and production credits
- IMDb - Verified air dates and episode titles
- YouTube/Bilibili - Found multiple reaction videos and fan content
- Podcasts - Located several podcast discussions covering this episode

### Key Findings

#### Characters
- **Kokoro**: Station master at Shift Station. Her mermaid nature is not revealed in this episode but becomes important later. Voice actors: Ako Mayama (JP), Juli Erickson (EN).
- **Chimney**: 8-year-old granddaughter of Kokoro. 1/4 mermaid but appears fully human. Very energetic and cheerful.
- **Gonbe**: Rabbit who makes cat sounds and is believed to be a cat by Chimney. Running gag throughout the arc.
- **Yokozuna**: Giant frog who swims using the front crawl instead of breaststroke (humorous subversion). Later revealed to have connection with Franky.

#### Locations
- **Water 7**: Inspired by Venice, Italy. Major shipbuilding hub. Features canal system with Yagara Bulls for transportation. City is gradually sinking, with new structures built on old ones.
- **Shift Station**: Sea train stop operated by Kokoro. Small station serving as connection point for travelers.

#### World-Building
- **Sea Train System**: Revolutionary transportation created by legendary shipwright Tom. Connects Water 7 to St. Poplar, San Faldo, Pucci, and Enies Lobby.
- **Puffing Tom**: The main functioning sea train built by Tom.
- **Yagara Bulls**: Seahorse-like fish used for transportation in Water 7's canal system.
