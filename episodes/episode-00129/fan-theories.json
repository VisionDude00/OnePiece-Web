    "theoryText": "Vivi is considered an honorary member of the Straw Hat Pirates, and many fans believe she will soon officially become the 10th member of the crew. With recent revelations about her family carrying the Will of D, and Imu and the World Government now pursuing her, she can no longer safely return to Alabasta. Her best option is to permanently join the crew of the Thousand Sunny. Recent chapters show Vivi sending coded X mark messages to Luffy, hinting at her eventual reunion with the crew, likely during the Elbaf Arc.",
