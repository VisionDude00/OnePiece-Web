    "summary": "Theory that Spandam deliberately chose unknown Devil Fruits for Kaku and Kalifa as a power play or test of loyalty rather than giving them known powerful fruits.",
    "fullText": "Some fans theorize that Spandam's decision to give Kaku and Kalifa unknown Devil Fruits (rather than researching what they were first) was intentional. This could be either a loyalty test - seeing if they would consume unknown fruits for the mission - or a power play to keep them from becoming too powerful with known strong abilities. The fact that Spandam admits he doesn't know what the fruits are suggests either incompetence or deliberate manipulation.",

    "summary": "Theory that the World Government has a pattern of manipulating and deceiving giants to serve their purposes, with Kashii and Oimo being just one example.",
    "fullText": "The revelation that the World Government lied to Kashii and Oimo for 50 years about their captains being imprisoned suggests a broader pattern of how the government deals with giants. Fans theorize that the government specifically targets giants due to their strength and relative gullibility, using their loyalty and honor against them. This connects to broader themes about the government's manipulation of various races and cultures throughout the One Piece world.",
