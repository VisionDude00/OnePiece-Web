# Research Notes for Episode 271

## Episode Overview
Episode 271 "Don't Stop! Raise the Signal Fire of a Counterattack!" is a pivotal episode in the Enies Lobby arc that sets up major developments for the upcoming battles.

## Key Research Observations

### Devil Fruit Consumption Scene
- This episode features one of the most significant power-ups in the arc: Kaku and Kalifa consuming unknown Devil Fruits
- The fact that neither Spandam nor the agents know what powers the fruits will grant adds dramatic tension
- Both characters comment on the disgusting taste, which is consistent with other Devil Fruit consumption scenes in the series
- The actual powers won't be revealed until later episodes (Kaku's giraffe form and Kalifa's soap abilities)

### Giants' Defection
- Kashii and Oimo's switch from enemies to allies is a major turning point
- Their backstory about being lied to for 50 years connects to the Little Garden arc (Episodes 70-77)
- This reveals the World Government's willingness to manipulate even those who serve them loyally
- Their arrival with Sogeking provides crucial reinforcements at a critical moment

### Gomorrah's Sacrifice
- Gomorrah's determination to continue fighting despite being blinded is deeply moving
- His successful delivery of allies to the courthouse before collapsing shows incredible willpower
- Chopper translating Gomorrah's words adds emotional weight to the scene

### Tactical Coordination
- Kokoro's Den Den Mushi call provides crucial tactical information about the bridge mechanism
- This demonstrates the importance of communication and coordination in the rescue effort
- The Franky Family splitting up to activate the levers shows strategic planning

### Blueno's Abilities
- The showcase of Kaiten Door and Air Door demonstrates the versatility of the Doa Doa no Mi
- These abilities make Blueno a formidable opponent and show creative Devil Fruit applications
- The Air Door pocket dimension is particularly interesting as a tactical tool

## Animation & Production Notes

### Animation Errors
- Nami's Perfect Clima-Tact is shown with 4 bulbs instead of 3 (noted in trivia)
- This is a minor but documented error in the animation

### Manga Differences
- The manga scene of Baskerville summoning the Just Eleven Jurymen was removed
- The location of CP9 when receiving Devil Fruits is less explicit in the anime than manga
- The anime extends some emotional moments compared to the manga's pacing

### Opening/Ending Songs
- "Brand New World" by D-51 (Opening 6)
- "Adventure World" by Delicatessen (Ending 18)
- This is one of the last episodes to feature both opening AND ending themes
- Adventure World ends at Episode 278, after which there wouldn't be ending themes for 17 years
