    "fullText": "Recent flashbacks introduced Shakky, who resembles Hancock as the most beautiful woman of her era. Everyone was attracted to Shakky except Silvers Rayleigh - the only person who showed her no care is the one she developed love sickness for. Fans know that Shakky and Rayleigh end up together. If Oda follows this pattern, it suggests Luffy and Hancock will also end up together once his adventure ends, mirroring the relationship between the previous generation's Pirate King's first mate and a former empress.",

The theory proposes that Lili was the first character to be diagnosed with love sickness and may have founded the Kuja tribe and Amazon Lily. This would explain why love sickness is specifically a condition that affects Amazon Lily empresses - it could be genetic or cultural legacy passed down from Lili.

The theory notes that some empresses died from love sickness, which occurs when they suppress their emotions. Some fans speculate this might be the only way Oda explores suicide themes, as the condition could force an empress to waste away if she doesn't follow her heart.

    "fullText": "Some fans argue that Hancock's love sickness was cured long before the timeskip, as Elder Nyon mentioned in Episode 417 that what would save or cure Hancock was going to Impel Down along with Luffy to help him break in. According to this interpretation, the act of following her love and helping him (rather than suppressing her feelings) is what cured the condition. However, others counter that Hancock's continued emotional fixation with Luffy means the Love Sickness hasn't been fully cured - she just isn't dying from it anymore. The debate centers on whether 'curing' means removing the love or simply surviving it.",
