    "summary": "Based on their fearful reactions when discussing God and Upper Yard, some fans theorized that Conis and Pagaya know more about Skypiea's dark secrets than they're revealing to the Straw Hats.",
    "fullText": "When Episode 154 first aired, many fans noticed the subtle fear in Conis and Pagaya's voices when warning about Upper Yard and God. Their overly helpful nature combined with this fear led some to theorize they might be spies or informants for the mysterious God, forced to report on visitors from the Blue Sea. The theory suggested that their kindness might be a cover for surveillance, or alternatively, that they desperately wanted to warn the Straw Hats but couldn't speak freely due to God's omniscient observation.",

The most common prediction was a lightning-based Logia fruit, given the association with gods and sky islands. Some fans drew parallels to Thor and Zeus mythology, predicting that God would use lightning as his primary weapon. This would also create an interesting challenge for Luffy, as lightning is one of the few things that can hurt his rubber body.",
