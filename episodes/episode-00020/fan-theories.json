    "theoryText": "In Episode 20, when Nami sees Arlong's wanted poster among Johnny's collection, she visibly reacts with distress and anger before quickly hiding her emotions. This brief moment is early foreshadowing of Nami's traumatic connection to the fish-man pirate Arlong, which won't be fully revealed until the Arlong Park Arc (Episodes 31-44). Fans theorize that Oda planned this connection from very early in the series, making Nami's emotional reaction here a carefully planted seed for one of the series' most emotional storylines.",

Some fans pointed to Sanji's eventual development of fire-based kicks and theorized this might have been planned from his debut, possibly hinting at his Vinsmoke heritage and genetic modifications that wouldn't be revealed until much later in the series.",

This theory was reinforced when Sanji later used the alias 'Mr. Prince' during the Alabasta arc, and was eventually confirmed when his Vinsmoke family heritage was revealed. Fans believe Oda subtly hinted at Sanji's royal blood through his impeccable manners, etiquette, and chivalrous code from his very first appearance.",

    "theoryText": "Fan theorists have analyzed the Baratie itself as a metaphor for Sanji's character journey. The floating restaurant represents being stuck between two worlds: the adventurous sea (representing freedom and dreams) and the stable restaurant (representing duty and gratitude to Zeff). This duality reflects Sanji's internal conflict throughout the arc - his dream of finding All Blue versus his obligation to Zeff. The restaurant's unique position on the ocean mirrors Sanji's position between his past trauma and future dreams.",

This theory was confirmed when Sanji's backstory with Zeff was revealed, showing they nearly starved to death on a deserted island.",
