    "theoryText": "Mihawk was fully committed to killing Luffy specifically to test whether fate would protect him. Throughout their encounter, Luffy keeps avoiding Yoru through various circumstances, often because others interfered and protected him. Mihawk even calls him the 'heaven-sent boy' due to how lucky he is, suggesting he believes Luffy has some special destiny or protection.",

    "theoryText": "The theory suggests that Kuma's decision to volunteer as the World Government's test patient for the Pacifista project may have been part of a larger Revolutionary Army plan. Some fans theorize that Vegapunk might be sympathetic to the Revolutionary Army cause, and that by cloning someone loyal to the cause (Kuma), all the Pacifista clones would potentially carry that same trait. This could be a long-term infiltration strategy.",

    "theoryText": "Mihawk observes during Marineford that Luffy has a strange ability to make anyone around him an ally, calling it the most dangerous ability in the world. This theory suggests this isn't just charisma but an actual supernatural or Conqueror's Haki-related ability that unconsciously influences people to help him, which is why fate seems to constantly protect Luffy.",
