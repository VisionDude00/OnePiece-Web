    "summary": "Some fans theorize that the Warship Island Arc's inclusion of dragons was intentional foreshadowing for later canon dragon appearances, particularly Punk Hazard.",
    "fullText": "While the Warship Island Arc is filler and creates continuity issues, some fans believe it may have been early foreshadowing for dragons appearing in the canon story later (such as the artificial dragon on Punk Hazard in the New World). The arc's focus on ancient, extinct dragon species could have been the anime staff's way of introducing the concept of dragons to viewers before they became relevant to the manga plot.",
