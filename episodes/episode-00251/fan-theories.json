    "fullText": "After Episode 251 revealed Robin's sacrifice to protect the Straw Hats from a Buster Call, fans have theorized that this moment demonstrates Robin's growth from a lone survivor who only cared about learning history to someone willing to die for her nakama. This transformation is seen as crucial setup for her eventual role in revealing the Void Century and true history to the world. Her statement that she only wants to learn history, not resurrect ancient weapons, is seen as foreshadowing that her knowledge will be used for good, not destruction. The theory suggests that Robin's bond with the Straw Hats will be what allows her to finally use her knowledge of the Poneglyphs to fulfill the will of Ohara and reveal the truth to the world.",

    "summary": "Some fans theorize that Admiral Aokiji intentionally gave CP9 the authority to call a Buster Call knowing it would force Robin to surrender, but also believing the Straw Hats would come to rescue her, testing both Robin and Luffy.",
    "fullText": "In Episode 251, it's revealed that Admiral Aokiji granted CP9 the authority to initiate a Buster Call. Given Aokiji's complex relationship with Robin and his past connection to the Ohara incident, some fans theorize this wasn't just standard procedure. They believe Aokiji, having met Robin and the Straw Hats earlier at Long Ring Long Land, was testing them. By giving CP9 this authority, he created a situation where Robin would be forced to show her true loyalties - would she run away as she always had, or would she sacrifice herself for her crew? Additionally, this would test if Luffy and the Straw Hats truly valued Robin enough to assault a World Government stronghold. This theory suggests Aokiji wanted to see if Robin had finally found nakama worth protecting, and if those nakama would fight for her in return.",

    "fullText": "Episode 251 shows the Going Merry being set adrift by the Galley-La foremen at the same time Robin's true sacrifice is revealed. Fans have theorized this parallel is intentional and meaningful. Just as Robin is giving up her freedom and life to protect the crew, the Merry is being cast aside as unsalvageable. However, the theory suggests that the Merry, having developed a spirit (Klabautermann), understood the situation and allowed itself to be set adrift not to die, but to position itself to later rescue the crew from Enies Lobby. This would explain why the Merry appears at the perfect moment during the Enies Lobby escape - it was the ship's own sacrifice and determination to save its crew, mirroring Robin's sacrifice. Both Robin and Merry are willing to give everything for the Straw Hats.",
