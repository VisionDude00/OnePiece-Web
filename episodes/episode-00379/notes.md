- Various blog recaps and analysis articles

**Key Finding:** This episode is significant as the final episode aired in 4:3 aspect ratio for analog broadcasts, marking a technical transition point in the series.

**Emotional Impact:**

- Sets up the payoff in episodes 380-381 with full backstory and "Bink's Sake" recording

## Challenges and Blockers

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Limited Script Access:** Could not find a full episode transcript/script. Relied on episode summaries, recaps, and wiki information for event details and quotes.

2. **Timestamp Estimation:** Without access to the actual episode video, all timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and scene descriptions from sources. These should be verified against the actual episode.

3. **YouTube Content:** Search attempts for YouTube analysis videos didn't yield specific results. This may be due to search limitations or content availability. Found TikTok content instead.

4. **Voice Actor Verification:** Some minor character voice actors could not be confirmed. Only major characters have verified voice actor credits.

5. **Exact Quotes:** Without a script, quotes had to be reconstructed from recap descriptions. These may not be word-for-word accurate to the actual dialogue.

### Information Gaps:
- No complete episode script found
- Limited detailed scene-by-scene breakdown
- Podcast episode reviews not found (searched but no specific podcast episodes about this episode discovered)
- Some minor character names from Rumbar Pirates not available
- Exact engagement metrics for external media not available

### Verification Needed:
- All timestamps should be verified by watching the actual episode
- Quotes should be verified against actual dialogue
- Scene descriptions should be confirmed with episode viewing
- Animation quality assessment is marked as "STANDARD" but should be verified

## Additional Notes

This episode is a crucial emotional centerpiece of the Thriller Bark arc. The flashback structure means it's almost entirely set 50 years in the past, making it unique compared to typical One Piece episodes. The connection to Laboon (first seen in Episode 62, over 300 episodes earlier) demonstrates One Piece's exceptional long-term storytelling.

The episode's focus on promises, friendship, music, and tragic fate creates powerful thematic resonance that will pay off in the following episodes (380-381) when Brook completes the story and the Straw Hats hear the recording of "Bink's Sake."
