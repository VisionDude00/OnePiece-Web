    "theory": "Brook's relationship with Laboon mirrors a potential connection between Joyboy and an ancient whale. The theory suggests that similar to Laboon waiting for Brook, there was a member of Joyboy's crew who was a massive whale far greater in size (similar to Zunesha). Evidence includes the massive tree carved into a whale at the center of Zou's city square, underneath which a Road Poneglyph is located. The theory proposes the One Piece treasure might be connected to recognition by such a whale - just as Brook cares for his afro so Laboon would recognize him even as a skeleton, this could have been Joyboy's thinking. The whale under Long Ring Long Land would recognize the person who claimed it as the reincarnation of Joyboy, the same as how Laboon would only recognize Brook because of his distinctive hairstyle.",

    "theory": "Brook's Devil Fruit (Yomi Yomi no Mi) grants him biological immortality after his one resurrection. This means after the Straw Hats accomplish their dreams and the series ends, Brook will face the same tragedy again - watching his beloved crewmates die one by one, just as he did with the Rumbar Pirates. He will be left alone once more, potentially for centuries, making his fate the most tragic of all Straw Hats. Episode 379's revelation of Brook surviving alone on a ruined ship for 50 years foreshadows this potential future.",
