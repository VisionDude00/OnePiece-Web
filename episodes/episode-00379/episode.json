  "description": "In an emotional flashback, Brook recalls his time with the Rumbar Pirates fifty years ago. The crew befriends a baby whale who follows them from the West Blue, naming him Laboon. When the pirates prepare to enter the Grand Line through Reverse Mountain, they realize Laboon is too young to face its dangers. Despite Laboon's determination to follow them, Captain Yorki and the crew promise to return in 2-3 years and leave him in Crocus's care at Twin Capes. The episode ends with the tragic revelation that only Brook survived as a skeleton, unable to fulfill their promise.",
