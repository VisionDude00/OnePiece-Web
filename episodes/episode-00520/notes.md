## Research Challenges

### Limited Episode-Specific Content
- Found limited YouTube content specifically focused on Episode 520
- Most video content covers the Return to Sabaody Arc as a whole rather than individual episodes
- General One Piece YouTubers (GrandLineReview, Tekking101) don't appear to have episode-by-episode reactions for this arc

### Fan Theory Availability
- Specific fan theories about Episode 520 are scarce in search results
- Most theories from this period have been archived or are difficult to surface through modern search engines
- Episode aired in 2011, so much of the contemporary discussion has been buried by newer content

- Unable to locate a full episode script or transcript for detailed timestamp verification
- Relied on wiki summaries, reviews, and episode descriptions for event sequencing
- Timestamps are estimated based on typical episode structure and available information

## Observations

### Character Development
- Brook: Demonstrates he can give up worldwide fame for his crew
- Franky: Shows he used his time wisely to upgrade himself for the New World
- The reuniting crew members show excitement and wonder at each other's changes
