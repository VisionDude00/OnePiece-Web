    "theoryText": "The discovery of the giant gravestone and the Humandrills in Episode 456 wasn't coincidental. Some fans theorize that Mihawk deliberately chose Kuraigana Island as his residence because the Humandrills, who learned combat by observing war, would provide perfect training partners for swordsmen. The theory suggests Mihawk may have been planning to train a worthy student even before Zoro arrived, and the island's natural 'training ground' with weapon-wielding creatures was intentional.",

    "theoryText": "Fans have theorized that the Humandrills' ability to mimic fighting styles they observe would play a crucial role in Zoro's training. Since the Humandrills learned from watching warriors during the Shikkearu Kingdom's war, and later would observe Zoro's techniques, they could serve as training partners who adapt to and counter Zoro's moves, forcing him to constantly evolve his swordsmanship. Some fans even suggested the Humandrills might have observed and mimicked Mihawk's techniques as well.",
