### Character Insights

#### Doflamingo
- Established as overwhelmingly powerful with both Conqueror's Haki and terrifying Devil Fruit abilities

- Respects Kuzan's power enough to retreat rather than fight

#### Smoker
- Demonstrates ultimate loyalty to his subordinates by using his body as a shield
- Knows about Vergo's connection to Doflamingo, making him a liability
- Saved by Kuzan, who calls him a friend

#### Kuzan (Aokiji)
- First post-Marine appearance since leaving the organization
- Mysterious presence on Punk Hazard raises questions about his activities
- Still cares about former Marine colleagues
- Powerful enough to make Doflamingo back down without fighting

### Fan Theories Discovered
1. **Caesar Recruitment Theory:** Kuzan was on Punk Hazard to recruit Caesar Clown for Blackbeard
2. **SWORD Operative Theory:** Kuzan is secretly working with the Marines' SWORD division as a spy
