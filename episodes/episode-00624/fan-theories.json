    "summary": "Kuzan was on Punk Hazard to capture Caesar Clown for the Blackbeard Pirates, as part of his undercover mission.",
    "fullText": "One popular theory suggests that Kuzan's presence on Punk Hazard wasn't coincidental - he was there to recruit or capture Caesar Clown for Blackbeard. Since Kuzan later joined the Blackbeard Pirates, fans theorize he was already working with them during this time and needed to do something to gain Blackbeard's trust. Caesar's scientific expertise with Devil Fruits and weapons would be valuable to Blackbeard's crew. However, when Doflamingo appeared and threatened Smoker, Kuzan's loyalty to his old friend took priority, causing him to reveal himself and potentially abandon his Caesar mission.",

    "fullText": "This theory proposes that Kuzan didn't truly leave the Marines, but instead became part of SWORD, the Marines' secret special forces unit. His 'defeat' by Akainu and subsequent departure was staged to allow him to infiltrate the Blackbeard Pirates as a deep cover agent. His appearance on Punk Hazard to save Smoker is cited as evidence - why would someone who truly left the Marines risk exposing himself to save a Vice Admiral? His final words to Smoker, reassuring him that he 'hasn't changed at all,' support this theory. Fans believe Kuzan is gathering intelligence on Blackbeard's operations and plans, similar to how X Drake infiltrated Kaido's crew.",

    "fullText": "This theory suggests that Kuzan's mysterious behavior throughout the series, including his timely appearance at Punk Hazard, is part of a larger plan to oppose Imu and the corrupt World Government. Fans point to his history with Ohara and Robin, his 'Lazy Justice' philosophy, and his decision to leave the Marines rather than serve under Akainu as evidence that he fundamentally disagrees with the World Government's methods. His appearance on Punk Hazard - an island that was the site of a government weapons research facility - is seen as potentially connected to uncovering secrets about the government. Some theorists analyze small details from his confrontation with Doflamingo (who has Celestial Dragon connections) as subtle foreshadowing of Kuzan's true allegiance against the upper echelons of World Government power.",

    "fullText": "Fans noticed that Doflamingo's first clear use of his Parasite puppet-control technique in episode 624 serves as perfect foreshadowing for what will be revealed about Dressrosa. Just as he forces the G-5 Marines to move against their will in this episode, he has been controlling Dressrosa's king and forcing citizens to kill each other through his strings. The imagery of people being helpless puppets unable to control their actions while remaining conscious mirrors the tragic situation in Dressrosa. This episode effectively establishes Doflamingo's power and the thematic element of control that defines his character and his rule over Dressrosa.",
