Garp. This foreshadows the reveal of Luffy's family connections and suggests that Aokiji and Garp have worked together as Marines.",

    "theoryTitle": "The Consequences of Davy Back Fights",
    "theoryText": "Episode 225 demonstrates that Davy Back Fights have lasting consequences beyond the immediate game. Kibagaeru's takeover of the Foxy Pirates shows that losing crew members in these competitions can lead to internal power struggles and mutiny. This suggests that the Davy Back Fight system, while treated comedically with Foxy, has serious implications for crew dynamics and loyalty in the One Piece world.",
