    "title": "The Sandai Kitetsu Curse Causes Zoro's Poor Navigation",
    "theory": "A popular fan theory suggests that Zoro's infamous lack of directional sense is actually caused by the curse of the Sandai Kitetsu. The theory proposes that the cursed sword leads its wielder toward their enemies and dangerous battles they cannot win, fulfilling the curse's purpose of bringing death to its owner. Evidence cited includes Zoro demonstrating navigation skills in Episode 2 (before acquiring the Sandai Kitetsu), but becoming completely directionally challenged after Episode 49 when he obtained the cursed blade. The sword's bloodthirsty nature and desire to cut may be influencing Zoro's movements, constantly leading him toward combat situations.",

    "title": "Zoro's Luck is Stronger Than Any Curse",
    "theory": "The iconic scene where Zoro tests the Sandai Kitetsu's curse is symbolic proof that Zoro's incredible luck and destiny are powerful enough to overcome any supernatural force. This theory suggests that Zoro's 'luck' is actually a manifestation of Conqueror's Haki or some other form of willpower that allows him to defy fate itself. The theory proposes that this moment foreshadows Zoro's later development and his ability to survive situations that should be fatal, as his will to become the world's greatest swordsman is stronger than any curse or obstacle.",

    "title": "Ipponmatsu Recognized Zoro's Destiny",
    "theory": "This theory suggests that Ipponmatsu, as a master sword expert, could sense something special about Zoro beyond just his courage in testing the cursed sword. The theory proposes that Ipponmatsu recognized Zoro as someone destined for greatness, possibly sensing his potential to become one of the world's greatest swordsmen. This is why he willingly gave up not just the Sandai Kitetsu, but also his precious family heirloom Yubashiri. Some versions of this theory suggest Ipponmatsu may have had a similar dream of becoming a great swordsman but gave it up, seeing Zoro as the one who could fulfill that dream.",
