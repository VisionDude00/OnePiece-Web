    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Naguri, despite being an anime-original character, might have been much stronger in his prime than shown. His possession of Conqueror's Haki suggests he was a formidable pirate captain. There's speculation that Roger sparing him and his crew might indicate Roger saw potential in Naguri or respected his character, similar to how Roger treated other worthy opponents.",

    "theoryText": "Fans have discussed why the anime chose to show this specific moment of Sabo revealing Ace's parentage to Luffy, which wasn't explicitly shown in the manga. Some theorize this was done to emphasize Luffy's unconditional acceptance of Ace regardless of his heritage, foreshadowing Luffy's later reactions during the Marineford War. The theory suggests this scene was added to strengthen the emotional impact of Ace's death and Luffy's determination.",

    "theoryText": "Some fans believe that Naguri's display of Conqueror's Haki in front of young Luffy was intentional foreshadowing by the anime team. Even though Luffy didn't understand what he was seeing, this early exposure to Conqueror's Haki might have planted a seed that would later manifest when Luffy awakened his own Conqueror's Haki. The theory suggests this was the anime's way of showing that Luffy had been exposed to this power long before he used it himself.",
