    "theoryText": "The matchup between Luffy and Enel wasn't just lucky - it may have been part of a larger pattern in One Piece where Devil Fruits have natural counters. Some fans theorize that Luffy's immunity to Enel's lightning was one of the first major demonstrations of type advantage trumping raw power, foreshadowing similar matchups later in the series.",

    "theoryText": "Many fans theorize that if Enel had left Skypiea and gone to the Blue Sea before meeting Luffy, he would have been virtually unstoppable. With a bounty potentially exceeding 500 million berries and Logia intangibility combined with observation haki (Mantra), very few characters at that point in the series could have defeated him. Luffy's rubber body was essentially the only common material that could counter him.",

This could be seen as foreshadowing his later development of more advanced techniques and his ability to counter observation haki users.",

This could be Oda's way of showing that even without the legendary weapons, combining Devil Fruit powers with advanced technology can create weapons of mass destruction.",
