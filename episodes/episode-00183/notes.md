### Research Challenges
1. **Limited Episode-Specific Content:** Most analyses cover the entire Skypiea Arc rather than individual episodes, making it difficult to find content specifically about Episode 183.
2. **No Transcript Available:** Could not locate a full script, relied on plot summaries and manga chapters.
3. **Age of Episode:** Episode aired in 2004, before many modern anime discussion platforms existed, limiting Reddit threads and recent analyses.
4. **YouTube Content:** While YouTube has many Skypiea Arc analyses, specific episode-by-episode reviews for episode 183 were not found.

### External Media Findings
Found 11 articles/sources covering the episode or arc:
- Wiki pages (highest reliability)
- Arc analyses and reviews
- Battle breakdowns
- Theory discussions
- One dedicated blog post about the episode

### Manga Comparison
Episode 183 adapts:
- **Chapter 280 "Floating"** (pages 2-19) - Rubber immunity reveal, Luffy's dream declaration
- **Chapter 281 "Deathpiea"** (pages 2-19) - Deathpiea activation, ricochet strategy

The anime extended combat sequences and added more dramatic citizen evacuation scenes.

### Severity Ratings Rationale
