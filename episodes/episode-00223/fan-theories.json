    "summary": "The Ocean's Dream Arc is directly based on the PlayStation game 'One Piece: Ocean's Dream!' This theory discusses whether elements from the game's extended storyline might have been cut from the anime adaptation.",
    "fullText": "Since the Ocean's Dream Arc is an anime-only filler based on the PlayStation game 'One Piece: Ocean's Dream!' (2003), some fans have theorized that the game contains additional story elements, characters, or plot points that were not included in the anime adaptation. The game may have featured different outcomes, additional locations, or alternative character interactions that provide a more complete version of the memory-theft storyline.",

    "fullText": "While the Ocean's Dream Arc is filler and the Nemu Nemu no Mi is anime-only, some fans have theorized about whether Oda might introduce a similar memory-manipulation Devil Fruit in the manga. The concept of memory theft has appeared in canon through characters like Pudding (who can manipulate memories with her Memo Memo no Mi), leading some to wonder if Noko's abilities were an early exploration of this concept. However, the Nemu Nemu no Mi itself remains non-canon.",
