    "theoryText": "Mihawk's observation in this episode that Luffy's ability to make allies is the most dangerous power on the sea is a critical piece of foreshadowing. This theory suggests that Luffy will ultimately achieve what Roger could not - uniting the entire world against a common enemy (potentially the World Government or Imu). While Roger became Pirate King through individual strength and a small crew, Luffy is building a vast network of allies across all seas, islands, and even former enemies. This 'unconscious' charisma and ability to inspire loyalty will be the key to defeating the final antagonist and achieving true freedom for the world.",

    "title": "Mihawk Lacks the Ability He Recognized in Luffy",
    "theoryText": "This theory posits that Mihawk's keen observation about Luffy's ally-making ability stems from his own lack of this quality. Mihawk is characterized as an 'anti-shonen' protagonist - he's powerful enough to be a Yonko but actively chooses not to make allies or build a crew. The theory suggests Mihawk may have once attempted a similar journey to Luffy's but failed because he couldn't form the bonds necessary to achieve greater goals. His solitary nature and distrust prevent him from making allies, which is why he recognizes this as the most dangerous ability - he knows from personal experience what he's missing. This explains why Mihawk never became a Yonko despite having the individual strength to do so, as becoming a Yonko requires not just power but influence and alliances.",

    "theoryText": "An interesting theory suggests that Mihawk's observation about Luffy's ability to make allies also applies in reverse to Imu, the secret ruler of the World Government. While Luffy naturally attracts allies and builds genuine bonds, Imu rules through fear, control, and the erasure of history. The theory proposes that the final conflict will be between these two opposing philosophies - Luffy's freedom and genuine alliances versus Imu's totalitarian control and forced submission. Mihawk's observation essentially identifies the fundamental difference between a true leader (Luffy) and a tyrant (Imu). This theory suggests that Oda planted this line specifically to contrast these two characters' approaches to power.",
