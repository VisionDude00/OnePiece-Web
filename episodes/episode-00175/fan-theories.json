    "theoryText": "The Mantra ability introduced with Enel and his priests during the Skypiea arc was deliberate foreshadowing of the Observation Haki system that would become central to One Piece. This demonstrates Oda's long-term planning, as the power system didn't come out of nowhere - it was introduced as early as Episode 155 with the priests and Enel, though it wasn't formally named 'Haki' until the Post-War Arc.",

This naming pattern reflects Enel's god complex and the spiritual themes of the Skypiea arc.",

Evidence includes: (1) Visual similarities between Kalgara's tattoos and Monkey D. Dragon, (2) Garp wearing a dog mask similar to Shandia chiefs, (3) Most notably, Luffy successfully ringing the Golden Bell (Light of Shandora), which Wyper said only his family could ring, (4) The cover of Volume 27 showing Luffy with Shandia wings. Given Oda's deliberate foreshadowing, these connections seem too specific to be coincidental.",

    "theoryText": "Aisa being born with Observation Haki (Mantra) raises questions about whether this is a rare genetic trait or an inherited ability passed down through Shandian bloodlines. As the youngest known character to possess Observation Haki, her natural ability suggests that some individuals may be genetically predisposed to develop Haki, particularly within certain families or tribes. This could explain why the Shandian warriors are such formidable fighters despite living isolated from the world below.",
