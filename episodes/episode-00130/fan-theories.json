Her joining the Straw Hats is not just about survival but about finding a crew strong enough to reach the end of the Grand Line where the Rio Poneglyph might be located.",

His wariness demonstrates that he takes threats to Luffy and the crew seriously, even when Luffy himself is trusting. This sets up his protective nature that becomes important in future arcs.",
