# Episode 22 Research Notes

## Research Date
November 18, 2025

## Episode Overview
Episode 22 "The Greatest Pirate Fleet! Commodore Don Krieg!" is a pivotal episode in the Baratie Arc that introduces Don Krieg as a major antagonist and establishes key themes about compassion, honor, and deception.

## Key Research Findings

### Character Debuts
- **Don Krieg**: First full appearance in Episode 22 (though technically debuted at the end of Episode 21)
  - Bounty: 17,000,000 berries (highest revealed so far in the series)
  - Fleet: Originally 5,000 men across 50 ships
  - Current status: Reduced to ~100 survivors after encounter with Mihawk
  - Epithet: "Foul-Play Krieg"
  - Voice Actors: Fumihiko Tachiki (JP), Andy Mullins (EN)

### Major Story Elements
1. **Sanji's Philosophy**: This episode firmly establishes Sanji's core principle - "When people are hungry, I offer them food. That's all there is to it." This becomes a defining character trait throughout the series.

2. **Krieg's Betrayal**: The episode demonstrates Krieg's dishonorable nature, as he immediately attacks the Baratie after being fed, living up to his "Foul-Play" reputation.

3. **Power Scaling**: Reference to Krieg's fleet being decimated by Mihawk establishes the power difference between East Blue pirates and Grand Line threats.

### Production Details
- **Director**: Yoko Ikeda
- **Screenplay**: Junki Takegami
- **Storyboard**: Kōnosuke Uda
- **Animation Director**: Kazuya Hisada
- **Air Date (Japan)**: April 26, 2000
- **Manga Chapters**: 46-47

### Timestamp Estimation Notes
Since the script source didn't include exact timestamps, I estimated timestamps based on:
- Standard One Piece episode structure (opening ~90 seconds, recap ~30 seconds)
- Typical scene progression and pacing
- Logical story flow
- Events are estimated to be accurate within 1-2 minutes

### Research Challenges
1. **Limited Episode-Specific Content**: Most online content focuses on the Baratie Arc as a whole rather than Episode 22 specifically
2. **YouTube Search Unavailable**: Web search was intermittently unavailable, limiting ability to find specific YouTube reactions/reviews
3. **Timestamp Accuracy**: No official timestamp data available; all timestamps are estimates based on typical pacing

### Interesting Observations
1. **Long-term Character Return**: Don Krieg recently appeared in Episode 1150 (November 2024), over 25 years after his debut, suggesting Oda had long-term plans for this character
2. **Live-Action Differences**: Netflix's One Piece adaptation significantly reduced Don Krieg's role, essentially killing him off in seconds via Mihawk
3. **Thematic Importance**: While Krieg is often considered a "forgettable" villain, his arc serves important thematic purposes about the dangers of the Grand Line and the varieties of strength in the One Piece world

### External Media Found
- 1 episode-specific review (Medium)
- 2 arc-focused podcasts (Apple Podcasts, Audible)
- Several wiki pages (One Piece Wiki)
- 2 analytical articles about Don Krieg's character and recent return
- 1 article about Netflix adaptation differences

### Fan Theory Highlights
1. Theory that Don Krieg and Gin will return as allies (partially supported by Episode 1150 appearance)
2. Analysis of Sanji's philosophy foreshadowing his All Blue dream
3. Discussion of Krieg's defeat establishing power scaling for the series
