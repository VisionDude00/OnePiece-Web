## Episode Synopsis
Don Krieg arrives at the Baratie with Gin, starving and begging for food. Despite warnings from the staff about Krieg's notorious reputation for deception, Sanji feeds the pirate, standing by his philosophy that a cook must feed anyone who is hungry. Once Krieg regains his strength, he immediately betrays the restaurant and launches an invasion, demanding the ship and food for his 100 surviving crew members. This episode establishes the central conflict of the Baratie Arc's climax and defines Sanji's unwavering moral principles.
