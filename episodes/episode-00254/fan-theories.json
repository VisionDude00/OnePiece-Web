    "summary": "The Aqua Laguna and Water 7's rising sea levels foreshadow a global phenomenon where the entire One Piece world is slowly sinking due to rising ocean levels.",
    "fullText": "Fans have theorized that Aqua Laguna is more than just a local disaster - it's a preview of what's coming for the entire world. The fact that Water 7's flooding is getting worse every year because the ocean's waters are getting higher completely recontextualizes the situation. This theory connects Aqua Laguna with other water-related phenomena like the Sandora River in Alabasta, suggesting that the rising ocean levels are a world-wide problem that will be central to the series' endgame. The theory gained more credence with later revelations about the world slowly sinking.",

This theory emerged around the time of the Water 7 arc's airing, speculating about Aokiji's involvement given his appearance in the arc and his connection to Robin's past.",

    "fullText": "Fans have noted that Robin's sacrifice in the Water 7 arc deeply parallels her trauma from Ohara. As the only survivor of the Buster Call that destroyed her home island, Robin has always carried guilt about bringing danger to those around her. When CP9 threatened to use another Buster Call against the Straw Hats, Robin's decision to surrender wasn't just about protecting her friends - it was about preventing another Ohara-like tragedy. The theory suggests that Robin's arc in Water 7/Enies Lobby is fundamentally about overcoming this survivor's guilt and learning to accept that she deserves to live and be loved by her nakama.",

Like the world-ending flood in Ragnarok, Aqua Laguna is a recurring tidal wave that slowly destroys Water 7 over time. The annual nature of the disaster and its increasing severity each year mirrors the inevitable destruction prophesied in Norse myths, making it both a natural disaster and a mythological reference.",
