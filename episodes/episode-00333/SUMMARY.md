## Plot Summary

Episode 333 marks the pivotal midpoint of the Ice Hunter Arc. After Zoro helps the imprisoned Straw Hats escape their confinement, the crew confronts the Accino Family in decisive rematch battles throughout Lovely Land. The tide turns in favor of the Straw Hats as Franky and Chopper defeat Hockera, Nami and Sanji overcome Arbell and Salchow, and Luffy smashes Brindo back into the fortress.

The episode's emotional core centers on Puzzle, the captain of the Phoenix Pirates, who witnesses the Straw Hats' unwavering determination and remembers his fallen vice-captain Vigaro's sacrifice. In the titular moment, Puzzle removes his bandages to reveal his phoenix-shaped scar and regains his fighting spirit, confronting Campacino with renewed resolve. Meanwhile, the commotion awakens Don Accino, the patriarch with heat-based Devil Fruit powers, while Robin is taken hostage by Lil who desires her as a "big sister."
