- **Japanese Title:** ドルトンの覚悟！ワポル軍団島に上陸
- **Air Date (Japan):** October 7, 2001
- **Arc:** Drum Island Arc
- **Saga:** Arabasta Saga

## Key Research Findings

### Major Events Documented
1. **Avalanche Sequence** (04:30-08:45)
   - Luffy and Sanji fight Lapahns while climbing Drum Rockies
   - Sanji heroically saves Luffy and Nami from avalanche, dislocating his spine
   - Luffy helps rescue baby Lapin's parent from snow
   - Luffy begins carrying both Nami and Sanji up the mountain

2. **Dalton vs. Wapol** (12:30-19:30)
   - Wapol's forces land at Bighorn
   - Dalton confronts Wapol and demands he leave
   - Dalton's Devil Fruit (Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison) is officially named
   - Chess attacks with arrows; Dalton shields villagers
   - Isshi-20 doctors debut and treat Wapol's injuries

### Character Debuts
- **Isshi-20:** Group of twenty elite doctors serving Wapol (first appearance in Episode 82)

### Important Reveals
- **Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison:** First time the Devil Fruit is named in the anime (though Dalton used it in Episode 81)
- **BEFORE DAWN Ending:** Episode 82 is the first to use this ending theme (by Ai-Sachi, episodes 82-94)
- First ending to feature Nefertari Vivi in the animation

### Manga Differences
- In manga Chapter 136, Dalton severs Wapol's head (immediately reattached by Isshi-20)
- Anime censored this to show Dalton striking Wapol's chest instead

## Research Challenges

### Limited Resources
- Episode-specific scripts were difficult to find
- Most available resources covered the entire Drum Island arc rather than Episode 82 specifically
- Few dedicated YouTube reactions/analyses for this specific episode (most reactors cover episodes in batches)

### Solutions Applied
- Used One Piece Wiki (Fandom) as primary reliable source
- Cross-referenced multiple wiki pages (episode, characters, locations, Devil Fruits)
- Gathered arc-wide reviews and analyses that covered Episode 82 within their scope
- Used official streaming sources (Crunchyroll) for verification

## External Media Findings
- Found 1 reaction video (BiliBili covering episodes 82-83)
- Found 6 arc-wide reviews and analyses covering Drum Island
- Limited episode-specific content due to age of the episode (aired 2001)

## Fan Theories Discovered
1. **Wapol-Vegapunk Connection:** Theory about Wapometal being used by World Government's SSG
2. **Physics of Luffy's Attack:** Discussion about how Luffy sent Wapol flying so far
3. **Political Allegory:** Drum Island arc as commentary on anarchism and tyranny

## Incremental Data Approach
Following the research methodology, all data is **incremental** - only documenting what's NEW or significant in Episode 82:
- Character entries only include Episode 82 in `episodeAppearances` arrays
- Key moments are specific to this episode only
- No attempt to build complete character profiles
- Focuses on debuts, reveals, and significant events in THIS episode

## Additional Observations
- Episode 82 represents a critical turning point in the Drum Island arc
- Sanji's injury removes him from combat for the rest of the arc
- Dalton's character evolution from servant to hero is central to this episode
- The dual narrative (Luffy's climb + Dalton's stand) creates excellent dramatic tension
- Strong thematic resonance around sacrifice and protection of others
