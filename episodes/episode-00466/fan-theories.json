    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Luffy's straw hat, which Whitebeard recognizes as once belonging to Shanks and originally to Gol D. Roger, is connected to the giant straw hat frozen in Mary Geoise. The giant hat may contain secrets about the Ancient Weapons, the Void Century, or serve as a key to understanding the true nature of the One Piece itself.",

Some fans theorize that Shanks knew Luffy was special (possibly the inheritor of Roger's will or the prophesied figure) and that his sacrifice was a calculated investment in the future, not just an impulsive act to save a child.",
