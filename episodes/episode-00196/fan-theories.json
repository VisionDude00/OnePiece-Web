    "theory": "The G-8 Arc was originally intended to be a theatrical film, which explains its higher quality animation, cohesive plot, and well-developed characters compared to typical filler. In 2019, series director Konosuke Uda revealed this was indeed the case, confirming why the arc feels more polished than standard anime-only content.",

    "theory": "The 'Checkered Fate' theory draws parallels between the Straw Hats' journey through Jaya, Skypiea, and Long Ring Long Land to later arcs. Specifically, G-8 parallels the Zou arc - where instead of escaping a fortress they fell into, they need to enter a mysterious city on top of a wandering giant elephant. Both involve infiltration/escape challenges with a massive structure.",
