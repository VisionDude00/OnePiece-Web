    "fullText": "The Poneglyph at the Sea Forest contains an apology from Joy Boy for failing to fulfill his promise to the people of Fish-Man Island. Many fans theorize that this promise was to use the Ancient Weapon Poseidon (which Shirahoshi is revealed to be) to bring Fish-Man Island to the surface world, allowing Fish-Men and Merfolk to live alongside humans without discrimination. The theory suggests that Joy Boy's failure is connected to the fall of the Ancient Kingdom during the Void Century, and that Luffy will eventually fulfill this promise, which is why the Sea Kings say 'two kings will be born' and why Luffy is prophesied to destroy Fish-Man Island (by bringing it to the surface, thus 'destroying' it in its current form).",

    "summary": "Hody Jones represents the next generation of hatred and prejudice, showing how Arlong's extremist ideology has been passed down and radicalized even further, creating a cycle of violence.",
    "fullText": "Episode 536 explicitly shows Hody declaring his intention to revive Arlong's dream, with Arlong's silhouette appearing over him during battle. Fans theorize that Hody represents how hatred and prejudice can become even more extreme in subsequent generations. Unlike Arlong, who experienced actual oppression from humans, Hody's hatred is purely inherited ideology without personal experience of human cruelty (revealed later in the arc). This makes him even more dangerous, as his hatred is abstract and absolute. The theory suggests Oda is commenting on how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves, and how ideologies can outlive their originators and become even more extreme. This is particularly poignant given Nami's traumatic reaction to hearing Arlong's name again.",

    "summary": "The anime-original flashback showing Arlong saving young Dosun and the other Fish-Man children adds depth to Arlong's character, suggesting he genuinely believed he was protecting his people, not just seeking power.",
    "fullText": "The anime added a flashback in episode 536 showing Dosun being kidnapped by pirates as a child, with young Hody and the other future New Fish-Man Pirates officers trying to rescue him, only to be saved by Arlong. This scene, while not in the manga, reinforces the idea that Arlong was seen as a hero and protector by young Fish-Men on Fish-Man Island. Fans theorize this was added to show that Arlong's actions, while evil, came from a place of wanting to protect his people from human cruelty. This makes the tragedy of the Fish-Man Island arc deeper - Arlong's protective actions inadvertently created a new generation of extremists who took his ideology even further. The theory suggests this demonstrates how well-intentioned protection can morph into destructive extremism across generations.",

    "fullText": "In episode 536, Zoro engages Hody in underwater combat, which should heavily favor the Fish-Man. However, Zoro holds his own and even lands successful attacks like Yakkodori. Fans theorize that this demonstrates Zoro's mastery of Observation Haki (Kenbunshoku Haki) learned from Mihawk during the two-year timeskip. By using Observation Haki, Zoro can predict Hody's movements even in the water where visibility and mobility are limited. Additionally, his ability to cut through water with compressed air attacks suggests advanced Armament Haki (Busoshoku Haki). This scene serves as subtle foreshadowing of the Straw Hats' new abilities before they're explicitly revealed, showing that Zoro has truly reached a level where even environmental disadvantages can't completely neutralize him.",
