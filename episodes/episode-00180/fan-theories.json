    "theory": "Some fans theorize that the 'Fairy Vearth' Enel seeks isn't actually the moon (where he eventually goes), but rather a sunken continent connected to the Ancient Kingdom. This theory suggests that the moon was a secondary destination and that the true 'endless earth' refers to lost landmasses beneath the sea, potentially connecting to the broader mysteries of the Void Century and the fall of the Ancient Kingdom.",

    "theory": "Based on Enel's revelation of his Fairy Vearth plan in this episode and his eventual journey to the moon, fans theorize that Enel will return during One Piece's final saga. The theory suggests that his knowledge of moon technology, ancient automata, and his lightning powers will make him relevant to endgame conflicts. Some speculate he could even become an ally against a greater threat, or that his moon discoveries contain crucial information about the Void Century.",

    "theory": "Fans have theorized that Enel's ability to restart his own heart using electrical defibrillation (revealed in the next episode but set up here) demonstrates a level of biological knowledge that could have broader implications. Some speculate this technique could be connected to Vegapunk's research or could explain how certain characters survive seemingly fatal injuries. The theory extends to suggest that electricity manipulation might play a role in life-extension or resurrection technologies in the One Piece world.",

Fans theorize that Enel represents a critique of leaders who commit atrocities while claiming divine authority or natural order as justification. The theory extends to suggest that Oda is making broader statements about religious extremism and the danger of absolute power throughout the Skypiea arc.",
