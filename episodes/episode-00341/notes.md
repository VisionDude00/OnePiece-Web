## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Episode Scripts
- Could not locate a full, publicly available transcript of Episode 341
- Had to rely on episode recaps, summaries, and wiki information
- Used detailed plot summaries from multiple sources to piece together events

### Challenge 2: Timestamp Accuracy
- Without direct access to the episode video or official transcript, timestamps are approximate
- Based timestamps on:
  - Episode recap descriptions
  - Typical One Piece episode structure (opening at ~3 minutes, events throughout)
  - Logical flow of events
- **Accuracy estimate**: ±1-2 minutes per timestamp

### Challenge 3: Voice Actor Information
- Found Japanese and English voice actors for main characters

- Found arc-level reviews but not Episode 341-specific YouTube videos
- Patreon content exists but is behind paywalls

- No other first-time character appearances (Absalom and Perona debuted earlier)

### Devil Fruit Usage

### Critical Reception

## Final Notes

This episode represents a significant and controversial moment in the Thriller Bark arc. The Absalom bathroom attack scene has been widely discussed and criticized, making it one of the more memorable (for both good and bad reasons) episodes of the arc.

The episode effectively splits the narrative between two groups:
1. **Mansion Group** (Nami, Usopp, Chopper): Facing horror and danger from Absalom and Surprise Zombies
2. **Island Group** (Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, Franky): Comic adventure encountering bizarre creatures

This tonal split is characteristic of the Thriller Bark arc's attempt to blend horror and comedy, though the execution of the Absalom scene remains controversial among fans and critics.

The research was thorough given the available online sources, though direct episode viewing would enhance accuracy of timestamps and potentially reveal additional subtle details or visual gags that text recaps might miss.
