    "theory": "The concept of 'nakama' established in Episode 43 becomes the philosophical foundation of the Straw Hat Pirates and influences every major arc. Luffy's declaration 'Nami, you are my friend!' sets the precedent that the crew fights not for treasure or glory, but for each other. This moment foreshadows future arcs where Luffy will go to extreme lengths to rescue or support his crewmates (Enies Lobby for Robin, Whole Cake Island for Sanji, etc.).",

I know I need help to accomplish my dream!' is one of the most important lines in One Piece as it establishes that strength comes from acknowledging weakness and relying on others.
