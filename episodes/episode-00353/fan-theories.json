    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Brook already reunited with Laboon during the two-year timeskip. Evidence includes Brook becoming less concerned about protecting his afro post-timeskip (he was previously extremely protective of it, fearing Laboon wouldn't recognize him without it), and his willingness to engage in dangerous combat without worrying about preservation. If he already delivered the Rumbar Pirates' final song to Laboon and confirmed the whale would recognize him regardless, it would explain this behavioral change.",

    "author": "Various One Piece theorists",

    "theory": "Fans theorize that Brook's story serves as a parallel to Joyboy's journey. Both involve promises made centuries/decades ago that could not be fulfilled, leading to a long wait. Joyboy was the first pirate in history, and the Rumbar Pirates were active around 50 years ago, suggesting a possible connection. Moreover, Joyboy's Devil Fruit allowed him to spread happiness everywhere, similar to how the Rumbar Pirates were a unique crew who spread smiles and warmth to all islands they visited. This parallel structure suggests Brook's eventual reunion with Laboon might foreshadow or mirror how the Joyboy/ancient promise storyline will be resolved.",

    "theory": "Many fans believe that Brook's reunion with Laboon will not happen until the very end of One Piece, possibly as part of the series' epilogue. The theory suggests that the Straw Hats will complete their circumnavigation of the Grand Line and return to Reverse Mountain/Twin Cape, where both Brook can fulfill his 50-year promise and Luffy can have his promised rematch with Laboon. This would bring the series full circle, as Reverse Mountain was where the Straw Hats entered the Grand Line. The reunion would symbolize the successful completion of their journey and provide emotional closure to one of the series' longest-running plot threads.",

    "author": "One Piece analysts",
    "platform": "YouTube/Blogs",
    "datePosted": "Unknown",
    "theory": "Laboon represents one of the clearest examples of One Piece's central theme of 'inherited will.' The whale's decades-long wait demonstrates unwavering loyalty to a promise, even though he knows some of the Rumbar Pirates are dead. When Brook eventually reunites with Laboon, it won't just be one survivor returning—it will represent the entire Rumbar Pirates crew's will being fulfilled through Brook. Similarly, Luffy's promise to return to Laboon shows how new generations inherit and honor the promises of the old. This theory suggests that the Laboon subplot is Oda's way of teaching readers about the importance of keeping promises and how one person can carry the dreams and promises of many.",
