## Research Challenges

### Limited Script Availability
- No complete episode transcript was found during research
- Had to rely on wiki summaries, fan recaps, and manga chapter information
- Timestamps are approximate based on typical episode pacing and wiki descriptions

### External Media Gaps
- Limited YouTube reaction/analysis videos specifically for episode 585
- Most content creators group episodes 585-587 together
- No specific Reddit discussion threads found for this episode alone

### Voice Actor Information
- Multiple English voice actors listed for some characters due to different dubs (4Kids, Funimation, ODEX)
- Used primary Funimation dub actors as the standard for English VAs

## Notable Observations

### Episode Pacing
Episode 585 adapts only 17 pages of manga (Chapter 660, pages 3-19), demonstrating the anime's slower pacing during the Punk Hazard arc. This is typical of One Piece's anime adaptation during this period.

### Animation Quality
Rated as STANDARD based on wiki information. No particular sakuga moments or animation highlights noted.

### Thematic Elements
The episode strongly emphasizes:
- Deception and hidden agendas (Law's lies, unclear motives)
- Power dynamics (Shichibukai vs Marines vs Pirates)
- Consequences of past actions (frozen prisoners, Caesar's experiments)

### Cultural Impact
- Episode received 9.0% TV rating in Japan (ranked 6th for the week)
- IMDb rating: 7.8/10
- Generally well-received as it introduces major plot developments

## Data Quality Notes

### High Confidence Items

- Complete character dialogue

## Fan Theory Assessment

2. Law's alliance with Caesar was temporary and strategic - CONFIRMED

## Recommendations for Future Research

3. **Reddit**: Try searching r/OnePiece directly for "episode 585" or "chapter 660" discussions

- **Screenplay**: Tomohiro Nakayama

## Spoiler Severity Decisions

### Events Rated MAJOR
- Law revealed as Shichibukai (ep585-event-004)
- 100 hearts revelation (ep585-event-005)
- Law's enhanced Tact ability (ep585-event-009)

- Franky Tank debut (ep585-event-002)
