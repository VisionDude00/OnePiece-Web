    "theory": "The Goro Goro no Mi, revealed in Episode 173, may have originally belonged to Thor, a giant from Elbaph associated with thunder and lightning in Norse mythology. This theory suggests that Enel killed Thor to obtain the Devil Fruit, which would explain why Thor is missing from Elbaph and why a lightning-based fruit exists. The Great Tree Adam in Elbaph can reach the sky islands, providing a possible connection between Enel and the Giants.",

The theory is supported by parallels between Enel and Imu (both destroy islands from the sky, have god complexes, use subordinates), and the potential that Enel learned important information about Sun God Nika on the moon. His Devil Fruit powers and knowledge could become relevant to the final conflicts.",
