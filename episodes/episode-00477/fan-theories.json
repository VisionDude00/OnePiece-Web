    "theory": "Many fans theorize that the two doses of Tension Hormones Luffy received from Ivankov (first in Impel Down, second in this episode) have significantly shortened his lifespan. Some speculate this could be 10-20 years total, while others believe the cumulative damage will manifest later in the series, potentially explaining why Luffy may not live as long as other characters despite his strength.",
