Luffy then uses Gear Third to destroy the cannon and split Spa Island in two, revealing an X-shaped underwater volcano beneath. The volcanic steam is revealed to be the final ingredient for the rainbow gem. Days later, Sayo and Lina complete the gem and send it to the Straw Hats, but Luffy immediately loses it.

### Fan Theories
No significant fan theories were found for this episode, which is expected given it's a non-canon filler arc. The arc doesn't contribute to the main storyline, so it generates minimal theory discussion.

### Research Challenges

1. **Limited Fan Content**: Being a filler episode from 2008, there's minimal modern fan content (YouTube reactions, TikTok videos, etc.) specifically about Episode 383

2. **Ending Song Confusion**: Initial searches suggested various ending songs, but confirmed that episodes 279-1070 had no ending themes

3. **Script Availability**: No full episode script was found during research. Information was compiled from episode summaries and wiki sources

4. **Social Media Content**: Very limited episode-specific content on social media platforms. Most content focuses on canon episodes or major story arcs

### Quality Assessment

**Completeness:** ✓
- Full episode information gathered
- All major events documented (15 events)
- Character information for all featured characters
- Animation credits verified

**Accuracy:** ✓

### Observations

1. **Filler Quality**: Reviews describe this as "not bad filler" - competent but not essential viewing

2. **Brook's Inclusion**: Significant that this is Brook's first filler arc appearance with the crew

3. **Anime-Original Techniques**: Dai Tetsugiri is anime-only and doesn't appear in manga

4. **Canonical References**: The arc references manga-canon elements (sea raccoons, circular rainbows from Chapter 490)

5. **Comedic Ending**: Typical One Piece humor with Luffy losing the gem immediately after receiving it

6. **Story Structure**: Classic rescue plot with emotional backstory reveal and action climax

### Recommendations for Future Research

1. If access to episode video becomes available, timestamps could be refined to exact seconds
2. Japanese fan sites might have additional content not found in English searches
3. Episode script from Japanese sources could provide exact dialogue for quotes
4. 2008-2009 era anime forums might have contemporary discussions
