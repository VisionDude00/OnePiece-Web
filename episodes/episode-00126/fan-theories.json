    "title": "Crocodile's Devil Fruit Awakening Prevented Rain",
    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Crocodile's Suna Suna no Mi (Sand-Sand Fruit) was actually in an awakened state, which allowed him to manipulate the weather and prevent rain from falling on Arabasta. The evidence for this includes the fact that rain immediately returned when Crocodile lost consciousness, and that Crocodile later demonstrates extensive knowledge of Devil Fruit awakenings. This would mean Crocodile wasn't fighting at full strength against Luffy since he was simultaneously maintaining the drought across the entire kingdom.",

    "title": "Crocodile Was Originally Female",
    "theory": "One of the most popular and prevalent theories in the One Piece community is that Crocodile was assigned female at birth (AFAB) and had Ivankov use the powers of the Horm-Horm Fruit to change their sex. This theory is supported by the 2019 Vivre Card Databook which states Crocodile has a 'weakness' from the past that Ivankov knows about. During Impel Down, Ivankov's threat to 'fix' Crocodile causes a pained reaction. Crocodile's Seraphim counterpart appears notably androgynous, further fueling speculation.",

    "theory": "An alternative theory suggests that Crocodile was once a slave to the Celestial Dragons and had the slave mark on his left hand, which is why he now has a hook instead of a hand. This would explain his deep hatred for the World Government system and his desperate desire for power and control. The theory suggests Ivankov's 'secret' relates to this traumatic past rather than gender.",

    "theory": "There's ongoing debate in the fan community about whether Crocodile caused the drought primarily through Dance Powder (the official explanation) or through his Devil Fruit abilities. Some fans note that Smoker explicitly stated he didn't use Dance Powder when accused, suggesting the substance's role might be overstated. The immediate return of rain upon Crocodile's defeat, combined with the visual of him literally draining moisture from people, suggests his Devil Fruit had a more direct role than officially stated.",

    "theory": "Some fans theorize that Gomu Gomu no Storm, which combines inflation, rotation, and momentum, serves as early foreshadowing of Luffy's later Gear techniques. The inflation aspect connects to Gear 3, the enhanced speed and momentum relate to Gear 2, and the creative combination of multiple Devil Fruit properties hints at the advanced techniques Luffy would develop post-timeskip. This theory suggests Luffy was already subconsciously exploring the concepts that would become his Gears.",
