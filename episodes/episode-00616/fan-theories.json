    "summary": "A theory that Vergo, who has glaringly obvious Terminator parallels, was created by Oda with specific intentions and is destined to 'come back' greater than ever, embodying an unyielding loyalty to Doflamingo.",
    "fullText": "This theory suggests that Vergo's character was intentionally modeled after the Terminator, with his unyielding loyalty to Doflamingo and his ability to survive being bisected. The theorist argues that Vergo embodies a Terminator-like mindset and that the Punk Hazard arc itself has parallels to Terminator movies. The theory proposes that Vergo will return in some form, possibly enhanced or modified, to continue serving Doflamingo's goals.",

    "summary": "A theory that Law's declaration about 'breaking the gear' of the old system is foreshadowing for the eventual destruction of the established world order and the rise of the new generation.",
    "fullText": "When Law declares 'I broke the gear' to Doflamingo, he's not just talking about destroying the SAD production. This theory suggests that Law's statement is symbolic foreshadowing for the Worst Generation's role in dismantling the entire world government system. The 'gear' represents the machinery of the old world - the Yonko system, the Warlord system, the balance of power. By destroying SAD, Law literally broke one cog in Doflamingo's machine, but metaphorically, he's announcing that the Supernovas will break all the gears holding the old world together. This connects to later events where the Warlord system is abolished and the Yonko system is disrupted.",

    "summary": "A theory that Smoker helping Law by returning his heart foreshadows a larger theme of Marines and Pirates working together against common enemies, particularly the World Government.",
    "fullText": "Episode 616 features a pivotal moment where Smoker, a Marine Vice Admiral, helps Law, a pirate and Warlord, by returning his heart to defeat Vergo, a corrupt Marine working for Doflamingo. This theory suggests this moment is foreshadowing for future alliances between 'good' Marines and pirates against corrupt elements of the World Government. Smoker represents the ideal of true justice that transcends the Marine/Pirate divide. This theme continues with characters like Fujitora, who also questions the established system, and may culminate in a final war where Marines and Pirates unite against the World Government. The theory also suggests Smoker's character arc is building toward him eventually leaving the Marines or reforming them from within.",
