    "theoryText": "The flashback scene in Episode 495 where Ace declares 'I never run away from a fight!' is deliberate foreshadowing by Oda of Ace's death at Marineford. This childhood trait of never backing down from a fight, especially when his loved ones are insulted, directly leads to his fatal decision to turn back and face Akainu when Whitebeard is insulted. The flashback arc establishes that this has been Ace's character flaw since childhood, making his death at Marineford tragically inevitable and true to his character rather than a poor decision.",

    "theoryTitle": "Sabo Was a Late Addition to the Story",
    "theoryText": "Some fans theorize that Sabo was not part of Oda's original plan for the story, pointing to an apparent continuity issue. In Episode 467 (during the Marineford arc), a flashback showed Luffy and Ace forming their brotherhood with sake without Sabo present. However, Episode 496 shows all three brothers (Luffy, Ace, and Sabo) officially christening their brotherhood with sake together. This inconsistency has led fans to speculate that Sabo was added to the story later, possibly during or after the Marineford arc, to give Luffy another connection to the Revolutionary Army and to provide emotional depth to the flashback.",

    "theoryText": "Episode 495's torture scene establishes that Luffy's unwavering loyalty to his friends - one of his most defining character traits throughout the series - was present even as a 7-year-old child. This scene serves as the foundation for understanding why Luffy goes to such extreme lengths to save his friends later in the series (such as invading Enies Lobby for Robin, breaking into Impel Down for Ace, and challenging Yonko for his crew). The theory suggests that this flashback was specifically crafted to show that Luffy's core values weren't developed over time but were innate to his character from the very beginning.",
