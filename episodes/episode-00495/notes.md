## Episode: "I Won't Run - Ace's Desperate Rescue Operation"

**Researcher:** Claude Code Agent

## Overview

Episode 495 is a flashback episode that takes place during the Post-War Arc (Summit War Saga). It continues the emotional backstory of Luffy, Ace, and Sabo's childhood following Ace's death at Marineford in Episode 483. This episode is particularly significant for character development and foreshadowing.

---

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Foreshadowing Ace's Fate

The most significant aspect of this episode is Ace's declaration: **"I never run away from a fight!"** This line directly foreshadows his death at Marineford when he turns back to face Akainu after Whitebeard is insulted. This flashback was animated AFTER the Marineford arc, so viewers watching this episode already know that Ace's refusal to run from fights leads to his death. This makes the scene particularly tragic and poignant.

### 2. Luffy's Core Character Trait

The torture scene where young Luffy refuses to betray Ace and Sabo establishes that his unwavering loyalty to friends was present even as a 7-year-old child. This is crucial for understanding Luffy's motivations throughout the entire series.

### 3. Timeline Context

This episode aired on April 24, 2011 in Japan (April 23, 2011 in US via Funimation simulcast), which was approximately 12 episodes AFTER Ace's death in Episode 483 (which aired in January 2011). Fans watching this flashback arc were still processing Ace's death, making these childhood scenes emotionally devastating.

## Research Challenges

### 1. Limited Transcript Availability

- **Challenge:** Could not find a complete word-for-word transcript of the episode
- **Solution:** Used multiple sources including wiki summaries, chapter content, and episode descriptions to piece together dialogue and events
- **Impact:** Timestamps are approximate (within 30 seconds to 1 minute) rather than exact

### 2. Conflicting Information on Ending Theme

- **Finding:** Episode 495 does not have a traditional ending theme song
- **Context:** Traditional ending themes were discontinued after Episode 279 and not reinstated until Episode 1071 (in 2023)
- **Note:** The episode would have used a "We Are!" remix instrumental during the next-episode preview segment

### 3. Voice Actor Information

- **Note:** Sabo's voice actor changed over time. For young Sabo in this episode: Junko Takeuchi (Japanese), Morgan Lauré Garrett (English)
- **Adult Sabo:** Later voiced by Miyu Irino (replaced Toru Furuya) in Japanese, Johnny Yong Bosch in English

## Notable Observations

### Emotional Impact

Multiple sources reference a particularly emotional moment at timestamp **09:28** in this episode that left many viewers in tears. This appears to be related to the scene where Luffy expresses his feelings to Ace about not wanting him to die.

### Pandaman Easter Egg

According to the One Piece Wiki, Pandaman makes a brief cameo appearance in a background scene at Gray Terminal, continuing his tradition of appearing in various episodes throughout the series.

### Episode Preview

The preview for Episode 496 was noted to be shorter than the standard length, though the reason for this was not documented in available sources.

### Simulcast Timing

Unusually, this episode aired in the US (via Funimation simulcast) **one day before** it aired in Japan. The US simulcast date was April 23, 2011, while the Japan broadcast was April 24, 2011.

## Continuity Questions

### Sabo's Brotherhood Ceremony

There is a noted continuity issue regarding the sake ceremony:
- **Episode 467** (Marineford arc flashback): Shows Luffy and Ace forming their brotherhood with sake, no Sabo present
- **Episode 496** (Post-War arc flashback): Shows all three brothers (Luffy, Ace, and Sabo) forming brotherhood with sake together

This has led to fan theories that Sabo may have been a later addition to the story, though this is debated in the community. Alternative explanation: There were multiple sake ceremonies at different times.
