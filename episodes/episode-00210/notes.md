- Reveals Foxy's true power

2. **Pickles** - The "Tackle Machine"
3. **Big Pan** - A wotan (half fish-man, half giant)

These characters are themed after sandwich ingredients (hamburger, pickles, bread/pan), which is a fun detail from Oda.

**Note:** Episode 210 is from 2004 and is part of a divisive arc (Davy Back Fight), which may explain the limited dedicated content. Most content creators focus on more popular arcs or current episodes.

### Fan Theories
No specific fan theories were found for Episode 210. The Davy Back Fight arc is generally considered:
- A lighter arc between major story arcs
- Not popular among many fans
- Appreciated by some for character moments

### Challenges and Limitations

1. **No Episode Script Access:** Could not find a full transcript or script for Episode 210, which limited the ability to capture exact dialogue and precise scene descriptions.

2. **Limited Video Analysis:** Did not have direct access to watch the episode, so relied on summaries and wiki descriptions.

3. **Timestamp Precision:** Without the actual episode, timestamps are educated estimates rather than exact timings.

4. **Voice Actor Information:** Could only confirm Japanese voice actors for main characters. English voice actors for minor characters (Groggy Monsters) were not readily available.

5. **Limited YouTube Content:** The age of the episode and the arc's mixed reception resulted in fewer dedicated analysis videos compared to more popular arcs.
