    "theory": "The One Piece treasure is an afro, similar to Brook's. This would explain why the Roger Pirates laughed upon seeing it. Just as Brook cares deeply about his afro so Laboon would recognize him, Joy Boy may have had similar reasoning. There may have been a 'member' of Joy Boy's crew who was a massive whale similar to Zunesha, and the afro was meant to help the whale recognize Joy Boy. Evidence for this theory includes the massive tree carved into a whale shape at the center of Zou, underneath which a Road Poneglyph is located.",

Since Brook is now a member of the Straw Hat Pirates and they're far into the Grand Line in the New World, Brook would have to complete the entire journey through the New World and then circle back from the other side of the globe to reunite with Laboon at Reverse Mountain. This means the emotional payoff of their reunion will be one of the final moments of the series.",

When the Rumbar Pirates crew commented that Brook's hair looked like Laboon, it was Oda planting the seed for Brook's character introduction hundreds of episodes later in the Thriller Bark arc.",
